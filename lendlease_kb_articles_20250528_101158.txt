Lendlease aims to attract, retain and motivate top talent by offering competitive and equitable remuneration, with a strong emphasis on pay-for-performance to align employee contributions with company success. Additionally, Lendlease places significant importance on transparency and fairness in its pay practices, ensuring employees understand how their remuneration is determined. The Company considers various factors when determining remuneration, including the skills and experience required for the role, market benchmarks, internal parity and company performance. Remuneration programs are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain competitive and aligned with the company’s overall strategic direction.
Our pay philosophy is a key component of our Employee Value Proposition, which also encompasses Group and employee performance-based bonus incentives, equity, non-statutory or additional benefits, development and learning opportunities, additional leave, as well as health and welfare benefits.

There are two key parts to how we pay our people:

Merit - Fixed (base) PayWe pay Merit fairly and within a pay range that is determined with reference to the external market. Some will be paid below the average and some will be paid above. We would expect most, but not all people, to be paid within the pay range.

Bonus - Variable Pay Some people may be eligible for a Bonus . Bonuses are used to reward our best performers. Bonus recommendations are determined by People Managers who consider performance against agreed goals, assess how an individual has achieved their goals and observe how they have demonstrated behaviours that show a commitment to the Lendlease values. Bonus terms and participation are subject to change from time to time and are determined by the Company. The Company can vary the terms and amount of a bonus, depending upon individual and Company performance.  

Note: To be eligible for a bonus you must be employed by Lendlease at the Bonus payment date and not under notice of termination. If you are under notice of termination (e.g. you have given notice of resignation or the Company has given you notice that your employment will terminate) or your employment has ended prior to the date a bonus is paid, or deferred securities are granted, you will not be eligible for the bonus or grant of deferred securities.

Compensable attendance at orientation, training
In-office conference calls
Hours worked inside and outside of the office, including work done at home

Compensation for Travel Time for Non-Exempt EmployeesCertain time spent by the employee in travel must be counted as hours worked. Commuting back and forth to work is not considered hours worked.Where an employee is asked to travel to a client site or another Company office other than his or her regular work site, only that part of the travel that exceeds the employee's regular commuting time to work will be compensated.An employee's travel from one client site to another during the regular workday is compensable work time.If an employee travels out of town during a regular workday, he or she will be compensated for all hours travelling and working, except for his or her regular commuting time to and from work.Overnight travel out of town, where the travel occurs outside of the employee's regularly scheduled working hours, and where the employee is a passenger on an airplane, boat, train or bus, is not counted as hours worked (unless the employee performs work while travelling).

What do reportable fringe benefits mean for me?

PURPOSE 
Lendlease recognizes and encourages the importance of bonding and nurturing, developing relationships and adapting to new environments. To create a workplace that is best for all, the company seeks to provide the support and flexibility that employees may need as they balance their commitments both inside and outside work. Therefore, if eligible, Lendlease provides Parental Leave for the primary parent pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this policy.  To the extent there is a conflict between this policy and any applicable law on the subject, the applicable law shall control.
The Parental Leave benefit provides paid leave for scheduled hours during the work week, for up to twelve weeks and an additional unpaid leave period of up to eight weeks for the following life events:

Birth of your child;
Adoption placement (up to age 18); or
Foster care placement (up to age 18).

For the purpose of this policy, a "primary parent" is defined as someone who has primary or full-time responsibility for the care of the child immediately following the birth or the arrival date of his or her child into the parent's home.  There may be only one primary parent per household.  If the employee is not the sole primary parent, they may be considered for Lendlease’s Partner Leave.
SCOPE  
This policy applies to all active full-time salaried, benefits eligible employees, scheduled to work 30 hours or more per week.
POLICY
Eligible employees may take Parental Primary Leave for up to 20 calendar weeks, of which the first 12-weeks are paid, provided the following conditions are met:
1. The employee seeking leave is the full-time primary caregiver parent during the period of the leave.  There may only be one primary parent per household.
2. The Parental Primary Leave must be taken within 12 weeks of the life event (i.e., the birth or placement of the child). To the extent permitted by applicable law, the unpaid portion of the Parental Primary Leave (up to 8 weeks) must be taken immediately following the paid 12-week portion.

If an FMLA-eligible employee elects to take the remainder of any unpaid Parental Primary Leave as FMLA, such leave must be taken within 12months of the life event.

3. The Parental Leave runs concurrently with short-term disability (STD) leave, when applicable.

The short-term disability 7-calendar day elimination period is paid with approved Parental Leave. Use of PTO is not required during the elimination period, so long as the employee is not rendered medically disabled prior to the delivery date and placed on STD leave early. If the employee’s doctor certifies them as disabled and the STD leave begins(and receipt of STD benefits) prior to the delivery date, e.g., bedrest, then the employee will be required to use accrued PTO, if available, during the elimination period.

Eligible employees must apply for Parental Leave after the life event has occurred (i.e., birth or placement of child) by: 
1. Completing the Parental Leave Request Affirmation Form.
2. Signing, dating and submitting the form to The Hartford for leave approval.

If approved, Lendlease will receive notification of the approval.
Approved Parental Leave time entry will be submitted on the employee’s behalf; employees and/or managers will not be responsible for time entry.

Any Parental Primary Leave taken under this policy will run concurrently with any short-term disability leave, FMLA leave, and any other state or local family and/or medical leave to which the employee is entitled, where applicable and permissible under law.
There may be only one primary parent per household.  For birth of a child, this is typically the birth parent, unless they are deemed mentally or physically unable to care for the child. For adoption or foster care placement, this would be the parent taking on the primary caregiver role.   If the spouse/domestic partner also works for Lendlease they have the ability to share the 12-calendar week paid portion of the Parental Primary Leave. If this circumstance applies, the employee must inform The Hartford at the time they file their Parental Primary Leave.
The Parental Leave Benefit will be 100% of the employee’s weekly salary.
If the employee is giving birth to the child, they must also apply for short-term disability benefits and leave. As set forth above, Parental Primary Leave will run concurrently with any short-term disability leave, FMLA leave, and any other state or local family and/or medical leave to which the employee is entitled, where applicable. Below are the steps to initiate the short-term disability process and the paid portion of the Parental Primary Leave.

Within 30 days of the due date, contact The Hartford at 888.301.5615 to initiate the short-term disability leave or visit The Hartford's web portal at www.abilityadvantage.thehartford.com
Within 30 days of the due date, the employee must notify their manager of their need for leave and estimated dates they plan to be on leave.
Once the delivery has occurred, the employee must complete and submit a Lendlease Parental Primary Leave Request Affirmation Form to The Hartford confirming they are the primary parent.

If the employee’s employment service is less than 5 years, the disability benefit payment is paid at 60% of their weekly salary; however, the approved Parental Primary Leave will supplement the disability benefit pay for a total payment of 100% of their salary.

In addition to the paid 12-calendar week Parental Primary Leave, employees may request additional unpaid leave, for up to 8 weeks, for a total of 20 weeks Parental Primary Leave. The additional 8-week unpaid leave time is subject to The Hartford approval. Follow the steps below to apply:
1. Employee contacts The Hartford at 888.301.5615 or visits The Hartford's web portal at www.abilityadvantage.thehartford.com
2. Employee completes and submits a Lendlease Parental Primary Leave Request Affirmation Form to The Hartford, confirming they are the primary parent.

Lendlease will receive notification of an approval, or denial, from The Hartford.
No time entry is applicable during the unpaid 8-week Parental Leave period.

During a 20-week Parental Primary Leave period, the employee shall continue to be eligible for benefits and their position with Lendlease will be protected. For the portion of the Parental Primary Leave that is unpaid and no paycheck is received, the employee will be responsible for submitting payment of their bi-weekly insurance premiums to Lendlease, so that there is not an interruption of healthcare benefits. Lendlease will send the employee a premium insurance statement in order to keep their insurance premiums up to date.
*This minimum service requirement does not supersede the terms of the short-term disability benefit program, which provides that an employee may be eligible for coverage beginning on the first day of employment, provided the employee meets the eligibility and other requirements for short-term disability leave and benefits payments
Employees are required to give Lendlease at least 30 days' advance notice of the need for leave when possible and practical to do so. When the need for leave is not foreseeable (e.g., last minute placement of a child or in the event of any emergency), the employee is required to give notice as soon as it is possible and practical to do so (following Lendlease's usual procedures).
Any questions about this leave should be directed to People Connect at 866-848-1200, option 2.

Lendlease support employees when they are requested to move across the country for extended periods of work, and operates a Domestic Mobility Framework to balance the impact of a move to an individual and their family, with the needs of the business.  The Domestic Mobility Framework has been developed for use across the Australia region, in all locations where Lendlease operates.  The framework provides direction and guidance for managers, employees and People & Culture professionals for structuring domestic assignments and transfers appropriately and consistently.
The framework ensures mobility at Lendlease: 

Is fair, equitable and competitive in the marketplace;
Provides resourcing solutions for projects whilst enabling talent development;
Is seen as a positive career differentiator and not a career risk; and
Is governed by policies and processes which are cost-effective, bench-marked and implemented consistently.

Depending on the situation, and whether the move is temporary or permanent, assistance under the framework may extend to: • Relocation transport (typically airfares) to the new location; • Relocation leave • Removalist costs • Temporary (or in some cases ongoing) accommodation assistance in the new work location Benefit amounts and allowances are subject to approval and allowances will generally be paid in addition to an employee’s Total Package Value (TPV).
Any exceptions to the policies require sign off by authorised representatives as per the Limits of Authority. 
The following policies define the support provided to employees in different circumstances.If you have further questions on the domestic mobility framework please contact People Connect or the relevant Stategic Business Partner.

A contingent worker is an individual who is not a permanent employee and can only be engaged through one of the following two methods:

Private Limited Company
Recruitment Agency

Lendlease does not engage directly with sole traders.
Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs (HMRC) regularly conduct audits in relation to employment status. If an individual has been treated as self-employed, but the paperwork does not support this, or if it fails to reflect the reality of the relationship, they will challenge the employment status of the individual. This could have financial implications for Lendlease.
If you are in doubt around a contract hire or have any questions, please contact Europe Contingent Resourcing. In the event of uncertainty, individuals should not be paid, until advice has been sought.

The Company forbids retaliation against any individual who files a charge of discrimination, reports harassment, or who assists, testifies or participates in an equal employment proceeding.

Harassment
Harassment is defined by Federal, State and (where applicable) local law. Harassment is a form of unlawful discrimination and violates this policy.  The Company’s prohibition against harassment and the related reporting mechanism is set forth in its Harassment-Free Workplace Policy and Complaint Procedure.
Harassment is against the law.  All employees have a legal right to a workplace free from harassment, including sexual harassment, and employees can enforce this right by filing a complaint internally with the Company, or with a government agency or in court under federal, state or local anti-discrimination laws.  The Harassment-Free Workplace Policy applies to all employees, applicants for employment, interns, contractors and persons conducting business with the Company.Remedy for Violation of Policy Violations of the Company’s Harassment-Free Workplace Policy, regardless of whether or not an actual law has been violated, will not be tolerated. The Company will investigate every issue that is brought to its attention in this area and will take appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment for employees who are found in violation of this policy.  Further remedies may be available by other agencies.Harassment-Free Workplace Policy & Compliant Procedure Policy Statement
The Company is committed to providing its employees with a work environment free of unlawful harassment.  In keeping with this commitment, the Company expressly prohibits harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and expression, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, military or veteran status, political affiliation and/or any other categories protected by applicable federal, state or local law.  Unreasonable interference with an individual’s work performance or creation of a hostile, intimidating or offensive working environment will not be tolerated.  All Company employees must act responsibly to help establish a comfortable working environment free from harassment.  The Company strongly disapproves of and will not tolerate harassment of employees by other employees, managers, supervisors or co-workers, clients or vendors.
This policy prohibits unlawful harassment in any form, including verbal, physical, or visual harassment.  This policy applies to all conduct between Company employees, including but not limited to, conduct during company events, including after-hours meetings, gatherings and celebrations with employees, clients, vendors, etc.  This policy applies to employees at all levels and positions within the Company.
Sexual Harassment
Generally, sexual harassment is unwelcome behavior that may or may not include sexual conduct. Both males and females may be victims of sexual harassment by persons of the same or opposite gender.  In particular, sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances or propositions, sexual flirtations, leering, verbal abuse of a sexual nature, subtle pressure or requests for sexual favors or acts, unwanted touching or intimacy, insulting or degrading sexual remarks or conduct, epithets, derogatory remarks or negative stereotyping based on gender, sexually explicit or offensive jokes, and the posting or display in the workplace of sexually offensive or degrading materials, electronic or otherwise.
Federal, state and (where applicable) local laws define sexual harassment as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other visual, verbal or physical contact of sexual nature when:

submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment; or
submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an employee’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.

The following are some examples of conduct which, if unwelcome, may constitute sexual harassment depending upon the totality of the circumstances, including the severity of the conduct and its pervasiveness:

Sexual advances – whether they involve physical touching or not;
Direct or implied requests by a supervisor for sexual favors in exchange for actual or promised job benefits such as favorable reviews, wage/salary increases, promotions, increased benefits, or continued employment;
Sexual epithets, jokes, written or oral references to sexual conduct, gossip regarding one’s sex life, comments on an individual’s body, comments about an individual’s sexual activity, deficiencies, or prowess;
Displaying sexually suggestive objects, pictures, cartoons;
Unwelcome leering, whistling, brushing against the body, sexual gestures, suggestive or insulting comments;
Inquiries into one’s sexual experience; and/or
Discussion of one’s sexual activities.

Protected-Class Harassment
In addition, federal, state and (where applicable) local laws prohibit any form of harassment that impairs an employee’s working ability or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and is based on or taken because of the employee’s race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, military or veteran status, political affiliation and/or any other class protected by applicable federal, state or local law.  Such offensive behavior may take a variety of forms, including, but not limited to:

Epithets, derogatory comments, jokes or slurs;
Derogatory or offensive posters, cards, objects, symbols, calendars, cartoons, graffiti, drawings, online postings or gestures;
Assaults, blocking normal movement or interfering with work; and/or
Retaliation for having reported or threatened to report harassment.

Who can be a target of sexual harassment?
Sexual harassment can occur between any individuals, regardless of their sex or gender.  The law protects employees, paid or unpaid interns, and non-employees, including independent contractors, and those employed by companies contracting to provide services in the workplace.  A perpetrator of sexual harassment can be a superior, a subordinate, a coworker or anyone in the workplace including an independent contractor, contract worker, vendor, client, customer or visitor.
Where can sexual harassment occur?
Unlawful sexual harassment is not limited to the physical workplace itself.  It can occur while employees are traveling for business or at employer sponsored events or parties.  Calls, texts, emails, and social media usage by employees can constitute unlawful workplace harassment, even if they occur away from the workplace premises or not during work hours.Any form of unlawful harassment creates an unprofessional and unacceptable atmosphere.  Regardless of its form, harassment of employees occurring in the workplace or in other settings in which employees perform their work is unlawful and will not be tolerated by the Company.  The Company will take reasonable steps to prevent harassing conduct by supervisory and non-supervisory employees, coworkers, clients, and vendors.  Further, any retaliation against an individual who, in good faith, has complained about workplace discrimination, retaliation or harassment, or who has cooperated with the Company’s investigation of such matters, is similarly unlawful and will not be tolerated.
In addition, the Company strictly prohibits its managers, supervisors and other employees from implying or suggesting that an applicant’s or employee’s submission to or refusal to submit to sexual advances or participation in such conduct is a condition of continued employment or receipt of any job benefit (including job assignment, compensation advancement, career development, or any other term or condition of employment). 
What is “Retaliation”?
Unlawful retaliation can be any action that would keep a worker from coming forward to make or support a harassment claim. Adverse action need not be job-related or occur in the workplace to constitute unlawful retaliation. 
Such retaliation is unlawful under federal, state, and (where applicable) local law. The law protects any individual who has engaged in “protected activity.”  Protected activity occurs when a person has:
filed a complaint of harassment, either internally or with any anti-discrimination agency;
testified or assisted in a proceeding involving harassment under an applicable human rights and/or fair employment law or other anti-discrimination law;
opposed harassment by making a verbal or informal complaint to management, or by simply informing a supervisor or manager of harassment;
complained that another employee has been harassed; or
encouraged a fellow employee to report harassment.
Reporting Procedures
The Company's reporting procedures (the “Company’s Reporting Procedures”) provide for a thorough and objective investigation of any harassment claim, appropriate disciplinary action against an individual or individuals found to have engaged in prohibited harassment, and appropriate remedies to any employee who has been a victim of harassment. 
The Company requires immediate reporting of all perceived incidents of harassment.  If you believe that you are being harassed, or if you believe that your employment is being affected by such conduct directed at someone else, you should discuss your concerns with your immediate supervisor or a People & Culture Strategic Business Partner. 
Additionally, employees may contact the Company’s Harassment Hotline at 1-866-513-2097.  Should employees know of an incident of harassment, they are expected to immediately utilize the available options outlined above for communicating such incidents.  The report should include details of the incident(s), the names of individuals involved, the names of any witnesses, direct quotes when relevant, and any documentary evidence (e-mails, notes, pictures, cartoons, etc.). The Company provides a complaint form which employees can use to report harassment and file complaints.  All employees are encouraged to use this complaint form.
The Company will conduct a thorough and objective investigation that ensures due process for all parties.  All persons involved, including complainants, witnesses and alleged perpetrators will be accorded due process to protect their rights to a fair and impartial investigation. The investigation will be completed, and a determination made and communicated to you as soon as practical. The Company will endeavor to protect the privacy and confidentiality of all parties involved to the extent possible consistent with a thorough investigation and any resultant disciplinary action.
If the Company determines that harassment in violation of this policy has occurred, disciplinary action up to and including immediate discharge will be taken. Appropriate action may also be taken to deter any future harassment.  Managers or supervisors who knowingly allow harassing behavior to continue will be subject to disciplinary action.
While the Company is confident that its internal complaint procedure will effectively address all complaints of violations of this policy and encourages employees to use this internal complaint procedure, employees who believe that they have been subject to unlawful harassment or discrimination also have the right to pursue legal remedies in court and/or file a formal complaint with the government agencies that investigate and prosecute complaints of unlawful harassment and discrimination in employment, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the “EEOC”) and state and local government agencies enforcing state and local laws (including the New York State Division of Human Rights and New York City Commission on Human Rights).  Information about filing a discrimination or harassment complaint with the EEOC is available on the EEOC’s website at https://www.eeoc.gov.  The EEOC can also be reached by calling 1-800-669-4000 or emailing info@eeoc.gov.  Additional information may also be available from state or local agencies, where applicable, regarding the procedures for filing administrative claims, and further information may be found here.
Supervisory Responsibilities
All supervisors and managers who receive a complaint or information about suspected sexual harassment, observe what may be sexually harassing behavior or for any reason suspect that sexual harassment is occurring, are required to report such suspected sexual harassment to People & Culture. 
In addition to being subject to discipline if they engaged in sexually harassing conduct themselves, supervisors and managers will be subject to discipline for failing to report suspected sexual harassment or otherwise knowingly allowing sexual harassment to continue. 
Supervisors and managers will also be subject to discipline for engaging in any retaliation.
Investigations and Non-Retaliation
We will investigate any claims of harassment promptly, impartially, thoroughly and, to the extent possible, confidentially.  The manner and extent of investigation and confidentiality is at the discretion of the People & Culture Department, as it deems necessary.  Investigations may include taking steps to obtain and preserve documents, emails or phone records relevant to the allegations, requesting and reviewing electronic communications, interviewing all parties involved, including any relevant witnesses, and preparing written documentation of the Company’s findings.
All employees are expected to cooperate in investigations of harassment complaints by providing truthful information in response to any inquiry.
After an appropriate investigation, any employee who is found to have violated this policy will be subject to disciplinary measures, as determined by the Company, up to and including termination.  Managers or supervisors who knowingly allow such behavior will be subject to the same measures.  Appropriate written documentation will be placed in his/her personnel file.
The Company prohibits any form of retaliation against any employee for filing a truthful complaint under this policy or for assisting in a complaint investigation.  Retaliation may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
If, after investigating any complaint of harassment, the Company determines that the complaint was untruthful or that an employee has provided false information regarding the complaint, disciplinary action, up to and including termination, may be taken against an individual who knowingly filed an untruthful complaint or gave false information.  Reasonable Accommodations The Company is committed to the fair and equal employment of all employees and it is our policy to reasonably accommodate qualified individuals with disabilities or religious needs unless the accommodation would impose and undue hardship on the Company.  A reasonable accommodation is any change or adjustment to the job application process, work environment, or work processes that would make it possible for the employee to perform the essential functions of their position.  Employees seeking an accommodation based on a disability or religious need which will allow them to perform the essential functions of their position should speak with their manager or People and Culture Strategic Partner, who will work with the employee to identify possible reasonable accommodations and to assess the effectiveness of each in allowing the employee to perform the essential functions of their position.  All information obtained concerning the medical condition or history of the employee will be treated as confidential.
Work Standards
The Company expects all employees to accept certain responsibilities, adhere to acceptable business principles in matters of personal conduct, and exhibit personal integrity at all times.  Employees must comply with the Company’s policies and procedures and observe the Company’s high standards of professionalism.
Solicitation & Distribution of Literature
Solicitation of an employee by another employee is prohibited if either employee is on working time.  Distribution of advertising materials, handbills, or any other literature by employees in working areas of the Company is prohibited at all times.  Solicitation or distribution of literature by non-employees on the Company’s premises is prohibited at all times.  Only official Company communications and notices may be posted on the Company's bulletin boards.
Workplace Violence
The Company expressly prohibits disruptive, threatening or intimidating behavior, as well as any acts or threats of violence, that involve or affect any current or former employee, customer, client, vendor, or other third party on or about its facilities or elsewhere at any time, either during or after working hours.
The Company absolutely prohibits the possession of firearms and/or other dangerous or deadly weapons by any employee, client, customer, vendor, visitor or other third parties while on Company property or engaged in Company business. Weapons include knives, explosives and any other object designed to cause bodily harm as defined by applicable laws.  This prohibition includes keeping or transporting a firearm or weapon in a vehicle in a parking lot area provided by the Company.
The Company will take immediate and appropriate disciplinary action consistent with applicable law against any employee who violates this policy, up to and including termination of employment.
Any employee who is aware of a violation of this policy must report it to his or her immediate manager or a member of the People & Culture Department.  In emergency situations, local law enforcement or the police should be notified immediately.  The Company will undertake a prompt investigation of any violation of this policy, maintaining confidentiality to the extent possible.  Retaliation of any kind against the party reporting a violation of this policy is strictly prohibited.
Serious Offenses
Certain acts are considered so serious that they normally will result in termination of employment for a single offense.  Such actions include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:

Discrimination in hiring, firing, pay, promotion, transfer, discipline, development, or establishment of terms and conditions of employment of any employee, or retaliation against an employee who has complained about discrimination or harassment.

Sleeping on the job or leaving the job without authorization.
Being convicted of a crime that indicates unfitness for the job or raises a threat to the safety or well-being of the Company, its employees, clients, or property.

This list is illustrative only and is not intended to cover every possible situation that may arise.  Any conduct that is detrimental to the Company's interests or security, or the safety or welfare of the employee or his or her co-workers, may result in corrective action up to and including termination of employment.
Substance Abuse and a Drug Free Workplace
The Company is committed to protecting the safety, health, and well-being of its employees and all people who come into contact with its workplace(s), property, and/or use its services as well as abiding by the laws governing illegal substances.  In accordance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, it is the policy of the Company to prevent the use of drugs from having adverse effects at its project and office sites and is committed to maintaining a drug-free workplace.
Prohibited Behavior
It is the policy of the Company that the use, sale, offer for sale, purchase, transfer, possession, manufacture, dispensation, trade, or presence in one's system of any controlled substance, including alcohol, illegal drugs, or intoxicants (“Controlled Substances”) by any person while on company/client premises, engaged in safety-sensitive Company business, operating Company/client equipment, applying for employment, or while under the authority of the Company is strictly prohibited.  Employees may not report to work or be subject to duty while their ability to perform their job duties is impaired due to on- or off-duty use of Controlled Substances.  This Policy does not prohibit the use of prescription or over-the-counter drugs as directed by a doctor and/or in accordance with the package directions, as long as the use does not impair the Employee’s ability to perform his or her job duties.
The Company expects employees to follow the legal requirements relating to the consumption of alcohol.  At no time is alcohol to be stored or consumed within the Company’s project sites or within its project trailers.  Within Corporate or Regional offices, at no time is alcohol to be consumed during core business hours on Company premises or while under the authority of the Company.  To the extent that employees share offices with other Lendlease businesses or anyone else with a more restrictive policy, the more restrictive policy governing that office would control.
Consequences
Employee compliance with this Policy is a condition of employment.  Failure or refusal to fully cooperate and comply with this Policy will be grounds for disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.  If an applicant for employment violates this Policy, the offer of employment will be withdrawn.
Notification of Convictions
Any employee who is convicted of a criminal drug violation in the workplace (including employees who plead no contest or nolo contendere) must notify the Company in writing within five calendar days of the conviction. The Company will take appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, within 30 days of notification. Federal contracting agencies will be notified when appropriate.
Communication
Communicating this drug-free workplace Policy to both supervisors and employees is critical to the Company’s success.  To ensure all employees are aware of their role in supporting the Company’s drug-free workplace program:

All employees will receive a written copy of this Policy.
This Policy will be reviewed in orientation sessions with new employees.
This Policy and any available assistance programs will be reviewed at safety meetings.
All employees will receive an update of this Policy annually with their paychecks.
Posters and brochures will be available at all locations.
Employee education about the dangers of alcohol and drug use and the availability of help will be provided to all employees.
Every supervisor will receive training to help him/her recognize and manage employees with alcohol and other drug problems.

Drug and Alcohol Testing
Each employee, as a condition of employment, will be required to participate in pre-employment, post-accident, reasonable suspicion, and random testing upon selection or request of supervisor or management.
In all instances drug and alcohol screening will be handled by the People & Culture Department both to ensure the integrity of the process and to protect the rights of the individuals involved.
Pre-employment Testing
Each offer of employment with the Company will be conditioned upon the passing of a test for alcohol and drugs as permitted by applicable law.  The Company will not hire any applicant who fails to pass the pre-employment alcohol and drug test.  Applicants refusing to take the test or sign the consent form prior to testing will not be hired.  Applicants will not be allowed to begin work until the Company receives a negative test result.
Post-Accident Testing
Employees will be subject to post accident testing if involved in an on-the-job accident, near miss on-the-job accident, or incident where injury or property damage did occur or might have occurred. The Safety Manager and/or the Director of Safety must be contacted for consultation prior to notifying the employee of the requirement to test.
Company employees involved in reportable on-the-job accidents will be sent for drug testing for the use of alcohol or controlled substances as soon as possible after the reported accident and after receiving appropriate medical treatment.
Reasonable Suspicion Testing
When the Company or its client have reason to believe that a drug/alcohol problem exists, the employees will be subject to testing after the manager has contacted the People & Culture Department for consultation.
Other Testing Programs
The company reserves the right to perform random testing at its discretion, in accordance with applicable law.
Refusal to Submit
An employee may not refuse to consent or submit to alcohol or controlled substances tests required by this Policy.  Refusal to submit includes failing to provide adequate breath or urine sample for alcohol or drug testing and any conduct that obstructs or interferes with any stage of the testing process.  This includes adulteration of or tampering with a urine or breath sample.
Failure or refusal to proceed directly and immediately to the collection site will be considered a refusal to test.  A refusal to test is considered a positive test result.  An employee who fails or refuses to proceed directly and immediately to the collection site will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination.
Confidentiality/Record keeping
All employee alcohol and controlled substance test records are considered confidential. For the purpose of this Policy/procedure, confidential record keeping is defined as records maintained in a secure manner, under lock and key, accessible only to the People & Culture Department.
Employee alcohol and controlled substance test records will only be released in the following situations:

To the employee, upon his/her written request;
Upon request of a government agency with regulatory authority over the Company;
Upon request of state or local officials with regulatory authority over the Company; and
Upon request by subsequent employers upon receipt of a written request by a covered employee.

Insurance is an important part of providing for our employees and their families in the event of illness, injury or unfortunately sometimes in the case of death.Having insurance to bring a level of financial relief during these times can provide great comfort to our employees and their families.Our permanent employees who are members in the Lendlease Superannuation Plan provided by Mercer, will be provided with the following insurances:• Death & Total and Permanent Disablement (Death &TPD)• Income Protection (IP)Please refer to the Insurance Booklet in the Resources section for specifics relating to policy coverage.Also note, that if you choose to join the Lendlease Superannuation Plan at a time other than when first joining Lendlease (for employees hired after 1 May 2018), your cover will be restricted to “new event” cover only for the first 2 years of membership and you may be required to complete medical tests at the discretion of the insurer. 
Death & TPD
This insurance is a compulsory component of membership within the Lendlease Superannuation Plan as provided by Mercer.Upon joining the plan, employees will be offered insurance based on a default formula of: Sum insured = 15% x Salary (excluding super) x years to age 65. Insurance based on the formula above will not require the employee to complete any medical tests provided they join when first offered to them (typically upon hire) and the total sum insured does not exceed $1.5 million. Members who transitioned from other Lendlease funds on 23 May 2018 may have other minimum levels of cover as specified in their transfer guide. The premiums for this insurance (using sum insured based on the formula) will be paid for by Lendlease. Any cover that a member has in excess of this default level, will have the additional portion of the premium deducted from their superannuation account.
Income Protection Also known as salary continuance, income protection provides a level of income should you become temporarily injured or ill which prevents you from working for a period of time. 
The cover provided to members is: Sum insured = 75% of salary (excluding mandatory super contributions), paid monthly for a maximum of 2 years. Premiums for this insurance are charged monthly to members accounts, at corporate rates which are typically lower than retail. This insurance is provided automatically when joining the fund, however members may choose to “opt out” if this cover is not required or already held privately via another policy.

Employment

Improper interference with the ability of Lendlease's employees to perform their expected job duties is strictly prohibited.
Lendlease will not terminate or in any way discriminate against any employee because they have inquired about, discussed or disclosed their own pay or the pay of another employee or applicant. Employees with access to compensation information of other employees or applicants as part of their duties may not disclose this information to others who do not have access to compensation information without express written consent from senior management, Legal or People & Culture.Lendlease is an affirmative action employer who recognizes the value of diversity in the workplace. To further the principles of equal employment opportunity, Lendlease has developed affirmative action programs for minorities and women, individuals with disabilities, and for disabled veterans and other eligible veterans.Recruitment & Hiring The Talent Acquisition team within People & Culture is committed to attracting and hiring top talent across the company. All Job Requisitions must be initiated by the Hiring Manager in Workday and follow our formal approval process.Once approved, a member of the recruiting team will conduct an intake call with the Hiring Manager to better define the scope of the role. The assigned Recruiter will sources and prescreen candidates for submittal to the Hiring Manager. The Recruiter will coordinate interviews and work with the Hiring Manager throughout the interview and selection process.Upon selection of a finalist candidate, the Hiring Manger will work with the Recruiter to determine appropriate offer parameters, facilitate a formal offer and commence the hiring process.Lendlease U.S. Immigration Policy To ensure that Lendlease U.S. (the “Company”) has the best talent needed to successfully complete a project or assignment, the Company may assist selected foreign-born individuals in their efforts to obtain documentation necessary to become and remain a Company employee in the United States. Nothing in this Policy or Procedure shall be regarded as a guarantee of continued employment nor as the basis for any part of a contract with an employee.  Employment with the Company is based on the mutual consent of the Company and the employee, as well as, the company's approval of associated costs.  Accordingly, either the Company or the employee may terminate the Employment relationship “at will,” at any time, with or without cause or advance notice.  Nothing in this policy entitles the employee to continued sponsorship if their employment in the U.S. is terminated. Employment of Part Time High School Students High school students who are at least 16 years of age or  older and who have working papers required by federal or state law may be employed part time provided they do not work on project sites.  Background Investigations All regular, full-time salaried and non-union hourly candidates for employment with the Company will be required to pass a background check according to this policy as part of the employment screening process.  Current or temporary employees, interns or co-op students may be required to undergo a background check at the discretion of the Company.  Employees who are rehired with less than 12 months break in service are not required to have a background check.  Rehires with a break in services greater than 12 months will be required to submit to a modified background check.The Company has selected an approved background check vendor and all offices and project sites are required to use the approved vendor for background checks. Notification & Authorization Applicants should be informed during the pre-employment process that all offers of employment are contingent upon the results of a background check. Applicants will be required to complete a consent form, which requests specialized information for the approved background investigation vendor. Applicants who refuse to authorize a background check will be denied employment. No employee is to begin the orientation process or assignment prior to obtaining the results of the background investigation.Any exception to this policy must be approved in writing by the Head of People & Culture.Use of Background Check Results Offers of employment must be made contingent upon successful completion of the background check.  Failure to meet the requirements of the background check will eliminate the applicant from further consideration for the position.  Some reasons that would qualify as a failure to meet these requirements are:
Inconsistency of information provided by the candidate versus that obtained by the background check Omissions of information by the candidate versus that obtained by the background check Unsatisfactory information uncovered by the background check Conviction of certain job related criminal offenses within the allowable reportable time period and /or any conviction of one or more of the following crimes which are all considered to be job related: Theft or Dishonesty Violent Crimes Alcohol/Drug-Related Crime 
The determination to eliminate an applicant from consideration for hiring on the basis of failure to meet the requirements of background verification will be made by the appropriate Human Resources Representative. Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) Compliance The FCRA is intended to give, among other things, a candidate for employment the opportunity to correct factual errors in his or her background check report before an adverse employment action is taken, and to be provided time between the employer's notification of any disqualifying information and the actual rejection of the employment application in order to correct, if possible, these discrepancies.When a background check report is received that contains information disqualifying the candidate from further consideration, the P&C Compliance Manager:
Send the candidate a letter notifying him or her that we have received such information.  Further, a copy of the report and a summary of his or her rights under the FCRA will be enclosed.  This notification is required before any adverse employment action can be taken based on the background check report. After five business days, a second letter will be sent to the applicant rejecting the candidacy based on the disqualifying information in the background check if information satisfactory to the Company negating the discrepant information has not been provided.
Employment Records & Reference Inquiries The Company collects various personal data necessary for lawful Human Resources Administration and Management. The information contained in personnel records is treated as confidential.  All requests for information on current or former employees must be referred to People & Culture.  Information given by phone will be limited to verification of employment dates and position title only.  In response to written requests (e.g. mortgage applications, etc.), information such as salary, dates of employment, job history, and position may be provided, if an authorization signed by the employee is provided. If and when requested by the Company, an employee's digital signature will be considered an accepted means of validating the signing employee's identity and an acceptable substitute for a wet signature on or in electronic documents and correspondence.As a global organization with global human resources functions and facilities, the Company will transfer employee’s personal and sensitive data worldwide among our group companies for the purposes of benefits and payroll administration, job transfers, etc.  If there is a change in any personal information, employees should notify People & Culture. It is very important that records are kept current to provide employees with correct pay and benefits and to contact the appropriate person in case of an emergency.If an employee wishes to review his or her personnel records, he or she should contact a People & Culture Representative.Offers of Employment All terms of the employment offer including proposed annual salary, bonus, relocation assistance, auto allowance or any other components of the offer must be discussed and approved, in advance, with the assigned Recruiter and/or Director of Talent Acquisition. In some instances, additional Senior Management approval may be required. All offer letters are generated by People Connect in Sydney.At Will Employment All employment and compensation with the Company is "at will" in that the employment relationship can be terminated with or without cause, and with or without notice, at any time, at the option of either the Company or the employee, except as otherwise provided by law. Nepotism Lendlease is committed to a policy of employment and advancement based on qualifications and merit and does not discriminate in favor of or in opposition to the employment of family members.
Due to potential for perceived or actual conflicts, such as favoritism or personal conflicts from outside the work environment, which can be carried into the daily working relationship, Lendlease will hire or consider other employment actions concerning family members of persons currently employed only if: a) candidates for employment will not be working directly for or supervising a family member, and b) candidates for employment will not occupy a position in the same line of authority in which employees can initiate or participate in decisions involving a direct benefit to a family member. 
“Family member” is defined as one of the following: relationships by blood—parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece and first cousin; and relationships by marriage—husband, wife, step-parent, step-child, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, half-brother, half-sister, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, and partner or significant other.Managers are responsible for ensuring policy compliance.  If any employee, after employment or change in employment, enters into one of the above relationships, the employee is responsible for immediately reporting the change to their manager.  All changes must be approved by the Head of People & Culture. Discipline The Company may choose to exercise its discretion to use forms of discipline that are less severe than termination, depending on the circumstances.  Less severe forms of discipline include, but are not limited to, verbal counseling and reprimands, written reprimands, involuntary transfers or demotions, and suspensions.  Although one or more of these steps may be taken in connection with a particular employee, no particular order or system is required, and the Company may or may not adhere to a “progressive” series of disciplinary actions.  The Company has the discretion to use whatever form of corrective action it believes is appropriate under the circumstances.  How the Company chooses to administer employee discipline in no way alters or limits the normal at-will employment relationship.  Termination of Employment The Company reserves the right to terminate the employment of any employee at any time, with or without cause, and with or without prior notice. Terms and conditions of employment, including a defined period of employment, cannot be guaranteed by any member of management. The provisions of this Policy will not limit the employment at-will relationship between employees and the Company.Voluntary Termination Standard business practice requires that employees provide the Company at least two weeks written notice before the resignation date. Employees who do not give two weeks notice may not be eligible for rehire. Involuntary Termination All involuntary terminations must be pre-approved by People & Culture and an Executive Team Member. There will be no exceptions to this policy. 
An employee’s “Last Day Worked” is the last day an employee is actively performing his or her job duties. This is the effective date of termination. Upon an employee’s termination, the employee will receive his or her unused, accrued PTO and information regarding the continuation of employee benefits or conversion privileges that may be available. For additional information, the employee should consult a People & Culture Representative.
Rehire Former employees may be considered for re-employment. Consideration will be based on previous work performance, supervisory recommendation at the time of prior termination from the Company, subsequent work record and other job-related factors.  Re-employment within 12 months of termination will result in a revised service date taking into consideration the number of months not employed at Lendlease.  This revised service date will be used for benefit eligibility such as short term disability, service awards and PTO.  Re-employment after 12 months will result in a brand new service date equal to their most recent date of hire and no prior service will be recognized.  Please note that certain benefit plans are based on most recent date of hire regardless of how long you were unemployed by Lendlease.  For 401(k) purposes, if an employee has completed one year of continuous service prior to leaving the company, eligibility for company match will be immediate.

Work Environment
Work Hours To maintain an effective work environment, the Company has established its working hours to align with overall company operations and individual departmental needs.  Therefore, some positions and employees in different locations may be required to work varying schedules.In general, the regular workweek is Monday through Friday, 40 hours per week. The regular workday is generally from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. with a 60-minute unpaid break for lunch. At times, it may be necessary for the company to change work hours to accommodate the needs of the business.  Employees are expected to work the hours assigned by his or her manager. Failure to adhere to the assigned hours may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.Attendance and Punctuality The Company expects all employees to arrive to work on time and consistently for the work schedule assigned.  Therefore if an employee is unable to report for work, the employee is to notify his or her supervisor or department head immediately.  Specifically, this requires that the employee must directly notify his or her supervisor by telephone or in person on each day he or she is absent.  Sending an email or relaying a message through a coworker is not sufficient.  Such notice must be provided as far in advance as possible.If an employee is absent for more than three (3) days, the employee may be required to produce a physician’s statement.  Excessive absences or tardiness may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.  An employee absent from work for two consecutive days without notifying the department head or direct supervisor will be considered to have terminated due to job abandonment.Employee Appearance All employees are expected to observe good habits of dress, grooming and personal hygiene.  While many offices of the Company may adopt “business casual” attire, at no time will any of the following be permitted:
Jeans with holes or ragged edges Cut-offs T-shirts with logos or slogans Sweat suits Halter or strapless tops Beachwear or beach sandals Baseball caps
While the above is not an exhaustive list, all employees are expected to use good judgment and taste in matters of appearance.Workers’ Compensation All employees are insured for accidental injuries sustained on the job or while performing duties for the company under state Workers’ Compensation laws. The amounts of such compensation, including any pay to be received for time missed from work and medical coverage costs, are established by state law and the rulings of the state regulatory body.Workplace Emergency The Company is committed to protecting all employees’ safety in the event of an emergency.The local emergency action plan addresses potential emergencies that may be expected in each location. In the event of an emergency evacuation, employees should use floor plans or workplace maps that clearly outline the emergency escape routes. Safe or refuge areas should be included in the plan.Every manager is expected to periodically review with employees the actions employees are to take in the event of an emergency.  This review should include the following:
Identify the individuals responsible for various aspects of the plan (chain of command) so that in an emergency confusion is minimized and employees have no doubt about who has authority to make decisions. Identify the method of communication that is used to alert employees that an evacuation or some other action is required as well as how employees can report emergencies (such as manual pull stations, public address systems, or telephones). Identify the evacuation routes from the building and locations where employees should gather. General guidance for fires and related emergencies includes: 
If an employee discovers a fire or sees/smells smoke, he or she should immediately follow these procedures: 
Notify the local Fire Department. Activate the building alarm (fire pull station). If not available or operational, verbally notify people in the building. If safely possible, isolate the area by closing windows and doors and evacuate the building. If safely possible, shut down equipment in the immediate area. 
If possible and if the employee has received appropriate training, use a portable fire extinguisher to: 
Assist oneself to evacuate, Assist another to evacuate, and Control a small fire. 
Do not collect personal or official items. Leave the area of the fire immediately and walk, do not run, to the exit and designated gathering area. 
Provide the fire/police teams with the details of the problem upon their arrival. Special hazard information known is essential for the safety of the emergency responders. Employees should not re-enter the building until directed to do so. 
If the fire alarms are ringing in the building, employees must evacuate the building and stay in the designated meeting location until notified to return. Managers must account for all employees within his or her group, keep them together, and report any missing persons to the emergency personnel at the scene. 
If an individual is overexposed to smoke or chemical vapors, remove the person to an uncontaminated area and treat for shock. If any employee suspects that a life threatening condition still exists (such as heavy smoke or toxic gases), do not enter the area. If CPR certified, follow standard CPR protocols and get medical attention promptly. 
Security All employees are expected to follow the security practices established at each location/project site.  In addition, employees are asked to report any suspicious activity or persons immediately to security.The Company recognizes an employee’s right to privacy; however, procedures regarding security are in effect to protect employees and to safeguard the property of the company.  Therefore, the Company reserves the right to inspect packages, cabinets, drawers, computer files, carrying cases, vehicles, etc.Fraternization A manager should not engage in any form of relationship with a subordinate employee that could potentially have the appearance of creating or promoting favoritism or special treatment for the subordinate employee. Accordingly, managers are prohibited from romantic involvement or engaging in sexual relations with any employee who reports to the manager or whose terms and conditions of employment are potentially affected by the manager.Smoke-Free Environment The Company will maintain and enforce a smoke-free environment and will prohibit smoking (including vaporizers, e-cigarettes, or any electronic smoking device) in all the Company offices (including all building stairwells, hallways, lunchrooms, break rooms, and restrooms) and functions.  If an employee wishes to smoke a tobacco product, he or she must do so outside of the work facility in designated smoking areas.  The Company will not retaliate against an employee for invoking this policy, or for requesting management's assistance in implementing this policy in the workplace.
Employee Concerns and Advocacy
Effective Communication of Workplace ConcernsLendlease supports the success and development of its employees by providing them with appropriate avenues for expressing their complaints and concerns. The company is committed to maintaining good employee relations through effective communication and the satisfactory resolution of work related issues.An employee who wishes to express a complaint or concern regarding a work related problem is encouraged to resolve the issue informally through dialog with his or her immediate manager. If the employee feels that direct communication with their immediate manager is not feasible because the problem involves accusations against that manager, or because the employee is for some other reason uncomfortable discussing it with their manager, an employee may contact a higher level manager. Employees may also contact their local People & Culture representative. In addition, employees may use the employee advocacy page to view the list of P&C leaders to express their concerns. Employees should feel free to raise any issue using any of these avenues of communication without fear of coercion, discrimination, or reprisal.  There will be no retaliation against any employee for raising concerns. The Company will attempt to keep confidential all such expressions of concern, any investigation, and the terms of any resolution to the extent practicable and appropriate under the circumstances.  It should be noted, however, that during the course of investigating and resolving concerns, some dissemination of information to others may be necessary and appropriate.Finally, employees who are not comfortable contacting those individuals may report any objectionable conduct by calling the Lendlease Confidential Hotline at (866) 513-2097.If the issue of concern to an employee involves conduct that may violate any of the Company's policies, the employee must report the conduct to People & Culture, so that an appropriate investigation can be initiated. If an employee reports such conduct to a company manager, the manager is required to notify People & Culture.

A great onboarding and induction process will set the employee up for success in their new role. It is imperative that Managers invest time in helping their new team member get settled into the Lendlease work environment and to ensure they complete all the necessary training.  A great induction & onboarding experience is also a requirement for employees moving to new roles – especially into new teams or regions. Starting in a new team for an employee can be just as challenging for those coming from another organisation. 
An induction checklist has been developed to support you as a manager. There is also an employee checklist for your new starter which can be downloaded from the Induction page on ServiceNow.
As a manager, you will receive automated onboarding notifications for your new starter via Workday.
The initial notification email will be sent prior to your employee's first day, followed by notifications on their first day, day 30, day 75 and day 90. These emails will provide you with a link to the checklists for onboarding and induction, and will act as a reminder to complete the relevant activities.
Your new starter will also receive induction notifications. It is important for you to support them in completing their own activities.
Remember to maintain contact with your new starter once the written offer has been accepted.

New Workday Onboarding module 
We have launched a new module in Workday to assist with the preparation and onboarding of new starters at Lendlease.
Prior to a new starter commencing, they will have access to this module to receive key pieces of information, messages and tasks that can assist the onboarding process. 
Managers need to complete the following to ensure the information and messages are correct:

Add a message to welcome the new hire
Select people for the new hire to meet
Complete the new hire checklist
Complete a questionnaire to ensure activities for the new hire have been completed

For information about how to do this, please refer to this one pager.
If you need assistance with Workday. Please reach out to peopleconnect@Lendlease.com
NOTE: This new tool is available to onboard salaried, permanent, fixed term contract employees. It does NOT include wages, casuals.

Apart from the checklists, are there any other resources to support me?
The New to Lendlease section of People Portal contains information for Managers and Employees to assist with Onboarding.

Lendlease seeks to support the ongoing education of its employees. Investment in education ensures Lendlease can:

Continually build employee capability to execute our business strategy; and
Ensure the future leadership of the business.

Lendlease will provide financial assistance through this Tuition Assistance policy for employees seeking an undergraduate or graduate degree.

The Company will require proof of the amount of assistance provided by other financial aids. 

SCOPE
The employee must have completed a minimum of 12 months continuous service prior to the start of the course for which reimbursement is to be provided. Twelve (12) months of continuous service shall be based on most recent hire date. For rehired employees, who are re-employed with Lendlease within 1 year, the 12 months of service will be based on the Service Recognition Date.

PURPOSE The Global Mobility Framework (GMF) governs the way that Lendlease supports its employees when they move across borders for extended periods of work.  The GMF replaces the International Mobility Policy which was launched in 2002.SCOPE The framework provides direction and guidance for managers, employees and People & Culture professionals to structure international assignments and transfers appropriately.Underpinning the framework are 3 policies which define the support provided to employees in different circumstances.

POLICY Basic PrinciplesUsing the GMF means Mobility at Lendlease will:

be fair and equitable, transparent and competitive in the marketplace.
provide resourcing solutions whilst enabling talent development in growth markets.
be perceived as a positive career differentiator and not a career risk.
be governed by policies and processes which are cost-effective, benchmarked and implemented consistently.
not be an opportunity to achieve personal financial advantage.

The GMF and associated policies are to be implemented across all locations in which we operate.  Exceptions to the policies require sign off by authorised representatives in Regional and/or Global roles.  Please refer to each individual policy for further guidance. GMF - Business Decision Tree The GMF uses a series of questions to assess which policy is most appropriate to the circumstances.  The decision tree below should be used by employees, line managers and P&C managers to assess which policy should be used for a particular assignment.  For full details of the assignment provisions please refer to the individual policy documents below.

Policy Changes
The Company reserves the right to amend the content of the Global Mobility Framework and its associated policies from time to time. REFERENCES Download International Transfer Policy Download Long Term Assignment Tax Equalised Policy Download Short Term Assignment Policy

PURPOSE Lendlease (the “Company”) will comply with the New York Paid Family Leave (NY PFL) law, which provides eligible employees on an approved NY PFL with a percentage of their average weekly wage while on the covered leave.   The purpose of this policy is to provide employees with a general description of their rights under the NY PFL law.  In the event of any conflict between this policy and the applicable law, employees will be afforded all rights required by law. NY PFL benefits are paid by the same insurance carrier that provides New York State disability benefits, The Hartford.  If you have any questions regarding this policy, you must contact The Hartford(the insurer and administrator of the NY PFL benefit program) at 888.301.5615 or online at www.abilityadvantage.thehartford.com.
SCOPE All Lendlease Employees in US.ELIGIBILITY
Full-time employees working in New York State for 20 hours or more per week will become eligible for NY PFL after the 26th consecutive work week of employment.  Part-time employees working less than 20 hours per week will become eligible for NY PFL after 175 working days.  Employees who: (1) work 20 hours or more per week but will not work 26 consecutive weeks in a 52-week period; or (2) work less than 20 hours per week but will not work 175 days in a 52 week period, may file a waiver of paid family leave benefits to exempt them from making contributions for NY PFL coverage.Employees may be eligible for NY PFL benefits even if they are not eligible for leave under the FMLA. Part-time employees are entitled to only a pro-rated percentage of the maximum NY PFL benefit available to full-time employees.
POLICY LEAVE ENTITLEMENT AND USAGE To qualify for job-protected NY PFL, the employee must be taking leave for one of the reasons listed below:1. To bond with a new child during the first twelve months after the child’s birth, or the first twelve months after the placement of the child for adoption or foster care with the employee;2. To participate in providing care (including physical or psychological care) for a family member with a serious health condition; or3. Because of any “qualifying exigency” (as interpreted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act), due to the fact that a family member is on or has been called to active duty.  NOTE:  NY PFL is not available for an employee’s own serious health condition or qualifying military event.Under this policy, eligible employees will be entitled to NY PFL as follows:
Beginning on January 1, 2020, eligible employees will be entitled to up to ten (10) weeks of NY PFL within any 52-week period.  
Beginning January 1, 2021, eligible employees will be entitled to up to twelve (12) weeks of NY PFL within any 52-week period.
NY PFL is only available in full day increments.  However, it may be taken intermittently, so an employee can take only the full days off during the week when he or she is caring for a family member or bonding with a child.   Successive periods of family leave caused by the same or related injury or sickness will be considered a single period of family leave if separated by less than three months.   The Company will not provide the same NY PFL to two or more employees at the same time to care for the same family member.NY PFL BENEFIT LEVELS NY PFL benefits will be increased annually until January 1, 2021. (New York State has discretion to delay the increases in certain instances.)  Subject to any delays or changes by the State, the amount of weekly benefits paid to an eligible employee for any 52-week calendar period will be as follows: 

January 1, 2020: 10 weeks paid at 60% of the employee’s average weekly wage or 60% of the state average weekly wage, whichever is less; and
January 1, 2021: 12 weeks paid at 67% of the employee’s average weekly wage or 67% of the state average weekly wage, whichever is less.

The New York State Average Weekly Wage is set every year after an analysis by the New York Department of Labor.Employees may elect (at their option) to supplement NY PFL benefits with accrued unused PTO.  Should an employee choose to use paid PTO, the Company may request reimbursement from the employee for any NY PFL benefits the employee received from the state during that period.  PERIODS FOR WHICH NY PFL BENEFITS ARE NOT PAYABLE Employees are not entitled to NY PFL benefits:

For any period of family leave during which the employee performed work for remuneration or profit;
For any period of family leave during which the employee is receiving total disability benefits under a claim for workers’ compensation.  (If an employee is receiving partial disability payments under a workers’ compensation claim, the amount of NY PFL benefits combined with the benefits under state law may not exceed the employee’s average weekly wage);   
For any period of family leave during which the employee is subject to suspension or disqualification of the accumulation of unemployment insurance benefit rights, or would be subject if he or she were eligible for such benefit rights;
For any period of family leave during which the employee is not employed or during which the employee is on administrative leave from his or her employment; and 
For any period of family leave commencing before the employee becomes eligible for benefits under the NY PFL program.

COORDINATION THE FMLA AND THE NY STATE SHORT-TERM DISABILITY LAW FMLA.  Employees who qualify for both FMLA leave and NY PFL must use leave under both statutes concurrently, and the Company will designate such leaves as running concurrently.   If the Company designates a period of FMLA leave for a reason covered under the NY PFL and notifies the employee of his/her eligibility under the NY PFL but the employee declines to apply for payment, the Company will nevertheless count the period of leave against the employee’s maximum NY PFL benefit.An employee may elect (but is not required to) to use accrued vacation or sick time while receiving NY PFL in order to receive full salary during the leave period.  New York State Short-Term Disability Law.  An employee’s combined total disability leave and PFL in any 52-week period may not exceed 26 weeks.COORDINATION WITH THE COMPANY’S PARENTAL LEAVE AND PARTNER LEAVE POLICIES Any NY PFL will run concurrently with leave taken pursuant to the Company’s Parental Leave and/or Partner Leave policies, to the extent the employee is eligible for such leaves.  The Company will request reimbursement of any NY PFL benefits paid to the employee for any periods of NY PFL taken that also qualify for leave under the Parental and/or Partner Leave policies.EMPLOYEE BENEFITS DURING LEAVE While an employee is on an approved NY PFL, the Company will continue the employee's healthcare coverage during the leave period at the same level and under the same conditions as if the employee had continued to work, provided the employee continues to pay his or her share of premiums during the leave. The employee must submit payment for their premiums and it must be received in the Benefits Department by the due date provided on the insurance invoice. If the payment is more than 30 days late, the employee's health care coverage may be terminated for the duration of the leave. Any employee whose healthcare coverage has lapsed during a NY PFL and who returns to work is entitled to have his or her coverage reinstated upon return to work, provided the employee provides timely payment of his or her share of premiums.EMPLOYEE STATUS AFTER LEAVE An employee who takes leave under this policy will be restored to the same or comparable job held prior to the approved NY PFL, in accordance with the terms, conditions and requirements of the New York Paid Family Benefits Law. REQUIRED NOTICE Employees must provide the Company / The Hartford with 30 days’ advance notice when the need for leave is foreseeable.  If the need for leave is not foreseeable, employees must notify the Company / The Hartford as soon as practicable.When the need for family leave is foreseeable and an employee fails to notify the Company and/or The Hartford without any special circumstances justifying the failure to provide adequate notice, the Company and/or The Hartford may delay or partially deny the request for NY PFL.Employees must provide notice sufficient to make the Company and The Hartford aware of the qualifying event and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. 
NO RETALIATION OR DISCRIMINATION
The Company will not retaliate or discriminate against any employee because the employee has taken NY PFL.

PURPOSE Lendlease and its subsidiaries and affiliates (hereinafter collectively referred to as “The Company”) is committed to serving its clients, customers, business partners, and the public in accordance with the highest ethical standards. SCOPE All Lendlease US Employees.POLICY Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations Obeying the law, in letter and in spirit, is the foundation on which the Company’s ethical standards are built. All employees must respect and obey local, state, and federal laws, and the rules and regulations applicable to the Company’s business, including, but not limited to, ensuring appropriate licenses and/or permits are obtained where applicable. Although not all employees are expected to know the details of these laws, rules, and regulations, it is important to know enough to determine when to seek advice from supervisors, managers, or other appropriate personnel who should consult with an Executive Officer as necessary or appropriate. Compliance with the law does not preclude the need to act with the highest ethical standards.Conflicts of Interest Each employee must ensure that he or she is free from the influence of any conflicting interests when he or she represents the Company in negotiations or makes recommendations with respect to dealings with third parties. A “conflict of interest” is any circumstance that could cast doubt on an employee’s ability to act appropriately regarding the Company’s interest or any situation that benefits the individual to the detriment of the Company. This may include owning or operating a related or non-related business. If a potential conflict arises, you must report it immediately to the General Counsel for the applicable line of business (referred to as the “Business General Counsel”). Employees who are unsure whether a potential conflict has arisen and/or if employees have any questions about conflicts of interest issues, they should contact the Business General Counsel.Giving Gifts, Entertainment and/or Services Employees are prohibited from giving, offering, or authorizing the offer, directly or indirectly, of anything of value (such as money, goods or a service) to a customer, business partner or government official to obtain any improper advantage. A business courtesy, such as a gift, contribution or entertainment, should never be offered under circumstances that might cause a conflict of interest or create the appearance of impropriety. Gifts of nominal value (AUS $150 or less) may be given if reasonable under the circumstances of the business relationship and consistent with customary business practices in the industry (e.g., lunch invitations, nominal value gifts at the holidays). Gifts exceeding the nominal amount must be approved by the Business General Counsel or another member of Executive Management. The giving of a cash gift or a check, in any amount, is strictly prohibited.Employees are strictly prohibited from giving, offering, or authorizing the offer, directly or indirectly, of anything of value (such as money, goods or a service) to any federal, state or local government official and/or government employee.If an employee is not sure whether a gift or proposed gift is appropriate, he or she must discuss the matter with the Business General Counsel or another member of Executive Management.Accepting Gifts, Entertainment and/or Services Employees are prohibited from accepting, directly or indirectly, anything of value (such as money, goods or a service) from a customer, business partner or government official. A business courtesy, such as a gift, contribution or entertainment, should never be accepted under circumstances that might cause a conflict of interest or create the appearance of impropriety. Gifts of nominal value (AUS $250 or less) may be accepted if reasonable under the circumstances of the business relationship and consistent with customary business practices in the industry (e.g., accepting a lunch or dinner invitation, tickets to theater or sporting event, or nominal value gifts at the holidays). Accepting materials from suppliers that are outside of arrangements that are made available to all employees is not allowed. Participating in employee discount programs must adhere to the program guidelines. The accepting of a cash gift or a check, in any amount, is strictly prohibited.Employees are strictly prohibited from accepting, directly or indirectly, anything of value (such as money, goods or a service) from any federal, state or local government official and/or government employee.If an employee is not sure whether a gift is appropriate, he or she must discuss the matter with the Business General Counsel or another member of Executive Management.The Lendlease US Gift Register is a site for Lendlease US Employees to provide information about gifts, entertainment and/or services that have been offered to them from third parties (i.e. customer or business partner). Gifts can be anything of value such as money, goods or a service. If you have accepted or been offered a gift with a value more than $300 please disclose the gift here. Although strictly prohibited by Lend Lease policy, we ask that you disclose any gifts offered to you by any government officials and/or government employees. Such gifts should also be disclosed on the Lendlease US Gift Register.Political Contributions The Company supports active participation in the political process and encourages its employees to become involved in civic affairs and to participate in the political process by supporting the candidates and issues of their choice. Employees must understand, however, that their involvement and participation must be on an individual basis, on their own time, and at their own expense. There are specific restrictions imposed on the Company by federal and state law with respect to its political contributions. Accordingly, no employee may expend or employ the Company's funds or facilities, directly or indirectly, on behalf of any political organization, campaign or candidate for public office, except with the express written permission of the Business General Counsel before going to the Chief Executive Officer of the business line for final approval. Reimbursement for fund-raising events for candidates or political organizations is prohibited. Personal services on behalf of a candidate, political organization or campaign on the Company’s time may be deemed contributions and are therefore prohibited. This policy has no effect on voluntary political service on personal time.Contract Negotiations In negotiating contracts, employees must be accurate and complete in all representations. The submissions to a client, including any domestic or foreign federal, state, or local government, of a proposal, quotation, or other document or statement that is false, incomplete, or misleading can result in civil and/or criminal liability for the Company, the involved employee, and any managers who condone such a practice. In negotiating contracts with any domestic or foreign federal, state, or local government, the Company has an affirmative duty to disclose current, accurate, and complete cost or pricing data where such data is required under appropriate law or regulation.Antitrust Laws The Company requires strict adherence to all antitrust laws. Such laws exist in the United States, the European Union, and in many other countries where the Company does business. Antitrust laws deal with agreements and practices in restraint of trade, such as price fixing; limiting supplies; dividing or allocating markets, territories, or customers; boycotting of suppliers or customers; disparaging or harassing a competitor; misrepresentation; stealing trade secrets; bribery; tying; and kickbacks.Antitrust laws are vigorously enforced. Violations may result in severe penalties such as forced sales of parts of businesses, significant fines against a company, substantial fines against individual employees and prison sentences. Employees involved in any dealings with competitors are expected to know that the United States and other countries’ antitrust laws may apply to their activities and to consult with Business General Counsel prior to negotiating with or entering into any arrangement with a competitor.Bidding and Performance Employees of the Company must comply with the laws and regulations that pertain to the acquisition of goods and services by our customers. The Company will compete fairly and ethically for all business opportunities. In circumstances where there is reason to believe that the release or receipt of non-public information is unauthorized, the Company shall not attempt to obtain and will not accept such information from any source.Appropriate steps should be taken by employees to recognize and avoid organizational conflicts in which one business unit's activities may preclude the pursuit of a related activity by another Company business unit.If the Company is involved in proposals, bid preparations, or contract negotiations, employees must be certain that all statements, communications, and representations to prospective customers are accurate and truthful. Once awarded, all contacts must be performed in compliance with specifications, requirements, and clauses unless appropriate modifications or waivers are obtained.The Company requires the maintenance of accurate and auditable records of all financial transactions in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles. No false or deceptive entries may be made, and all entries must contain an appropriate description of the underlying transaction. All Company funds must be retained in corporate bank accounts and no undisclosed or unrecorded fund or asset shall be established for any purpose. Further, all reports, vouchers, bills, invoices, payroll records, service records, and other essential data must be prepared with accuracy, care, and integrity.Confidentiality Information regarding the Company’s operations, planning, and financial status, both short and long term, must be kept confidential unless an authorized executive in the appropriate department within the Company decides otherwise and authorizes the release of such information in writing. Employees must maintain the confidentiality of confidential and proprietary information entrusted to them by the Company’s customers, clients, or business partners, except when disclosure is authorized by the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Financial Officer or required in writing by laws or regulations. Employees may not disclose any financial information without the prior approval of an Executive Officer.The Company and its employees must cooperate with appropriate government inquiries and investigations. In this context, however, it is important to protect the legal rights of the Company with respect to its confidential information. All government inquiries and requests for information, documents, or investigative interviews (whether in person, by telephone, email, or written correspondence) must be referred to Business General Counsel, who is responsible for coordinating a response.Upon termination of your employment for any reason, you are required to immediately return to the Company all Confidential Information then remaining in your possession. Without limiting the foregoing, employees who leave employment with the Company are further obligated to continue to recognize and uphold the confidentiality and proprietary nature of all Confidential Information acquired during the course of employment with the Company.In the event of any disclosure of Confidential Information in violation of the foregoing provisions, the Company would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. Therefore, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by an employee of this policy on Confidential Information, the Company shall be entitled to injunctive and/or other preliminary or equitable relief without any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity. Without limiting the foregoing, any breach or violation of the Company’s policy on Confidential Information is grounds for immediate disciplinary action, including, without limitation, termination of your employment.For those departments working with Confidential Information, at the end of the day and on weekends all such materials must be placed in secure, locked files. All legal and financial documents must be locked securely in file cabinets.All confidential computer and electronic files should be protected using passwords or other security tools. Additionally, users of the Internet or other networks are responsible for their activities on the network. Moreover, these networks should only be used for purposes that benefit the Company. Transmission of any material in violation of any U.S. or state laws or regulations is strictly prohibited.If you are unsure if something constitutes Confidential Information, or if you have any questions regarding this policy or your responsibilities in dealing with Confidential Information, please ask a member of Senior Management.Privacy The Company collects various personal data necessary for lawful Human Resources Administration and Management. The information contained in personnel records is treated as confidential. All requests for information on current or former employees must be referred to the People & Culture Department.To the extent permitted by local laws we may use and disclose your personal data to carry out appropriate business related checks.

This Lendlease policy relates to employees and new hires that are requested to permanently relocate.  There is a separate policy related to temporary relocations that does not involve asking the employee to change their current housing situation.  The policy that relates to temporary relocation is called Out-of-Town Living (OTL) and requires the individual to maintain duplicate living arrangements.  It is not anticipated that relocation benefits would be used in conjunction with OTL. Therefore be sure to understand the purposes of both policies when deciding on which approach is correct.Relocations consider employee assignments, client and business needs, length of assignment, proximity to employee’s home, and various other factors.  All reimbursements are made and reported in accordance with the prevailing income tax laws.   Eligible Employees All employees asked by the company to permanently relocate themselves, spouse/domestic partner or their family due to an assignment in a new city may be eligible for relocation benefits.  Under special circumstances only, newly hired employees will also be eligible for relocation benefits as part of a new hire package.While relocation benefit items will be granted according to each individual situation, items in the Standard area require normal approvals and items in the Non-Standard area require additional, higher-level, approvals. All approvals for relocation are granted as part of the Workday process.Pre-approval The Relocation Authorization Form must be completed and uploaded into the Offer, Promotion or Job Change within Workday. Workday approvals will also cover the proposed relocation details. Once all required approvals are obtained and the individual has signed their offer and relocation repayment agreement, the Mobility Specialist will be notified and the relocation process may begin. The expenses associated with employee relocation will be charged to the receiving cost center unless specified otherwise. Approved relocation expenses paid directly by the company to the relocation vendors will be sent directly to the Mobility Specialist. The Mobility Specialist will coordinate payment of the invoice and coordinate needed imputes or gross-ups for tax with the Lendlease Payroll group. Relocation Authorization Form Reimbursement Approved relocation expenses not directly paid by the company will be reimbursed to the employee. Requests for expense reimbursements, if on the employee’s Corporate Credit Card, must be submitted by the employee in the R-12 financial services system as expense reports. Requests for expense reimbursements of approved items paid by cash or on an employee’s personal check or credit card, may be reimbursed on a Relocation Reimbursement Request Form and then forwarded to the Mobility Specialist for processing.  If requested reimbursements include items that are an exception and/or have not been approved, then reimbursements will not be made until proper approvals have been obtained.Relocation items paid directly by the company and that require impute into income and/or tax details to be handled, will also be coordinated through Lendlease Payroll by the Mobility Specialist.Relocation Reimbursement Form Reimbursable Relocation Expenses Eligible employees may be reimbursed for some or all of the following relocation expenses based on the conditions of their new assignment.  Each employee’s relocation items may be different depending on the situation and are requested and approved by the Management of that area. No items are automatically granted and the specifics of any particular item may be limited to specific instructions as listed by the department.Gross-Up For Taxes – If approved, the Company may gross up any taxable relocation expenses at the supplemental withholding rates to help offset tax liabilities associated with taxable relocation benefits.Standard Relocation Items – require normal Workday Approval:
House Hunting Trips -The Company may reimburse the costs associated with a trip to the new location by the employee and spouse/domestic partner for the purpose of locating a new house or apartment.  This may be a maximum of 2 trips and includes round-trip transportation (coach or economy class), three (3) meals per day, rental car, if needed, and overnight accommodations for combined total of up to five (5) nights.

Income Tax Status of Provided or Reimbursed Moving Expenses  The following is an effort to help our employees understand the income tax implications of the reimbursement of relocation expenses:Income Tax Impact With the new income tax law changes effective in January 2018, all relocation benefits provided are now taxable. As required by IRS regulations, all amounts paid on behalf of, or reimbursed to, the employee must be reported as income on the employee's W-2.Amounts paid to an employee may, based on the Relocation Authorization Form approvals, be grossed up at the supplemental tax withholding rates to help offset any tax liability associated with the relocation.

Flexibility is important to Lendlease. It enables us to retain our people, which means continuity for our business and our clients.For Lendlease, flexibility is about when and where people work. It is an essential part of creating an effective organization. There is significant evidence that flexibility helps people work smarter and optimize resources and productivity in a highly competitive business environment.Flexible work arrangements are not an entitlement, so employees should not assume that if they ask for flexibility they will automatically get it. These work arrangements need to be mutually beneficial to the business and the employee. After due consideration, managers may turn down requests for a flexible work arrangement if business needs cannot be met.

What are the eligibility requirements?
All Lendlease active, salaried employees scheduled to work 30 or more hours per week are eligible to apply for flexible work arrangements. 
How do I submit a request for flexible working?

PLAN 

Review the eligibity criteriaRead through the documents available under the Resources section of this page 

PREPARE 

Work through Step 1 of the Implementation Approach document and make an initial consideration of the type of flexible work arrangement you intend to propose to your manager. Fill out the Flexible Work Arrangement Conversation Guide and submit it to your manager. 

ACT 

Discuss your interests and proposal for a flexible work arrangement with your manager; this stage of the process may take some time while you and your manager discuss and agree on the proposed flexible work arrangement. At the end of the discussions, if you and your manager have agreed and are satisfied with the terms, your manager may approve the flexible work arrangement. 

FINALISE

Once the flexible work arrangement has been agreed, sign and retain a copy of the Flexible Work Arrangement Conversation Guide. This will serve as a helpful reference to key aspects of the agreed arrangement. 

What are some examples of flexible work?
There are a range of creative and practical ways to change when and where work is done. Some of the more traditional forms of flexible work arrangements include:When people work • Flexible start/finish times. Flexible start finish times allow for employees and managers to negotiate start and finish times that work for all parties.• Reconfiguring workweek.• Part-time work. Generally speaking, working fewer than the standard weekly hours. Note: Benefits eligibility will be impacted if scheduled less than 30 hours weekly.When people work • Working remotely. Also called teleworking, this means working away from the main office or site (i.e. at home) either full or part-time, and on a regular or intermittent basis.• May be appropriate only during specific phases of a project.• Ensure you check the project contract for potential issues.Applicable examples include:Project site:• Ida Crown Jewish Academy in Skokie, IL - Team coordinated flexible start and finish times to accommodate rush hour and travel distances, while still allowing full coverage on site  - Superintendent starts at 6:00am and is generally the first person to leave the site  - Senior Project Manager starts between 6:30am/7:00am and is generally the next person to leave the site after the Superintendent  - Project Manager starts at 7:00am and is generally the last person to leave the site• Lumina in San Francisco, CA  - Mix of Project Managers, Control Staff and Field Superintendents take every fourth Friday afternoon offOffice-based:• Office-based people manager in PM&C works from home on regular basis, with schedule driven by calendar • Development Manager leaves at 2:30pm on Mondays and makes up the time by working in the evenings • Administrative Assistant starts at 6:30am and finishes at 3:30pm

PURPOSE  Lendlease recognizes and encourages the importance of bonding and nurturing, developing relationships and adapting to new environments. To create a workplace that is best for all, the company seeks to provide the support and flexibility that our employees may need as they balance their commitments both inside and outside work. Therefore, if eligible, Lendlease provides partner leave for the parent without primary care responsibility pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this policy. To the extent there is a conflict between this policy and any applicable law on the subject, the applicable law shall control.Partner leave is an employee benefit that provides a two-week paid leave, for normal scheduled hours during the workweek, for the following life events:

Birth of your child;
Adoption placement (up to age 18); or
Foster care placement (up to age 18).

For the purpose of this policy, a "partner" is generally defined as a spouse or domestic partner who does not have primary or full-time responsibility for the care of the child immediately following the birth or the arrival date of his or her child into the partner's home.SCOPE  This policy applies to all active full-time salaried, benefits eligible, employees scheduled to work 30 hours or more per week.POLICY Eligible employees may take a two-week paid partner leave for the birth of the employee’s child, the adoption or foster care placement of the child. The following requirements also apply to leave taken under this policy:

Paid partner leave must be taken within the first eight weeks from the life event, and in increments of no less than one business day, unless otherwise required under applicable law. (Eligible employees may still be entitled to FMLA leave taken within 12 months of the birth or placement of the child).
Paid partner leave is only available to the employee when the employee is not the full-time primary care parent during the period of leave.

The partner leave benefit will be paid at 100% of the employee's base salary and must be approved by their manager. The partner leave must be taken in increments of no less than one business day, unless otherwise required by applicable law. When entering partner leave hours, use pay type 46 (Partner Lv) within Time Entry within E1 employee self-service.During a partner leave period the employee shall continue to receive all employee benefits previously provided.An employee may become the primary full-time caregiver parent of the new child after the primary caregiver (spouse or domestic partner) has returned to their own employment or is no longer able to continue as the primary caregiver. If that is the case, the employee may be eligible for benefits under the Parental Primary Leave program.All leave taken under this policy will run concurrent with any FMLA leave, short-term disability leave, and any state or local leave to which you are entitled, where applicable and permissible under law.The employee must provide the employer with at least 30 days’ notice when the need for this leave is foreseeable.  When an employee becomes aware less than 30 days in advance the employee must provide notice to their supervisor as soon as reasonable.

Non-Discrimination No employee or prospective employee will be subjected to any form of employment discrimination or retaliation based on performing Active Duty in the Uniformed Services.Notification of Leave When scheduling military leave, employees should provide their Department Heads with a copy of their military orders.  Employees should notify their Department Heads of any such obligations as far in advance as possible so that arrangements can be made.  Employees will need to complete the Leave of Absence Request form and submit it to the Benefits Department along with a copy of the military orders.Paid Leave Basic Military Pay If, at the time the employee requests military leave, the employee’s military leave for Active Duty in the Uniformed Services is formally scheduled for a period of 2 weeks or less at the time the employee requests the military leave, then the employee is eligible for continuation of the employee’s full base pay, less any deductions required by applicable law, during the leave for a maximum of 2 weeks per calendar year.  A maximum of 2 weeks of this “basic military pay” will be paid for one military leave, even if an employee’s military leave extends into a second calendar year; and for this purpose only, two or more separate military leaves that commence within the same calendar year will be considered a single military leave.Supplemental Military Pay If, at the time the employee requests military leave, the employee’s military leave for Active Duty in the Uniformed Services is formally scheduled for a period that is more than 2 weeks, then Lendlease will pay the employee supplemental military pay as a supplement to the employee’s Military Pay.  The period covered by this supplemental military pay will start at the beginning of week 3, and will end 18 months following the date the employee’s leave began or, if earlier, on the date the employee is no longer on military leave for Active Duty in the Uniformed Services.Supplemental military pay is the pay added to the employee’s Military Pay to maintain the normal base pay that the employee was receiving from Lendlease just prior to the leave.  The amount of this “supplemental military pay” will be the employee’s normal base pay from Lendlease at the time the leave begins, less any deductions required by applicable law, and less Military Pay received by the employee. 

“Military Pay” is defined as an employee’s base pay from the Uniformed Services plus any allowances for longevity, ratings, special qualifications or hazardous duty.  It does not include subsistence, quarters, travel or uniform allowances.
An employee will provide written evidence satisfactory to Lendlease on a regular basis of the amount of Military Pay received. 
Lendlease will pay supplemental military pay in the same manner and on the same schedule as pay for a similarly-situated active employee, commencing with the applicable payroll date immediately following the date the employee’s leave begins.  However, supplemental military pay will not begin until Lendlease receives satisfactory evidence of the amount of the employee’s payments of military pay and military orders, and payment of any amounts that otherwise would have been paid under this policy before that information is delivered (if that information had been provided timely) will be delayed until Lendlease receives such evidence at which time all such missed payments will be paid in a lump sum; provided, to the extent necessary to satisfy Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to any amounts subject to that section, all or a part of such missed payments will be forfeited.

Employees on Military Leave at Effective Date of this Policy Any employee who currently is on Active Duty in the Uniformed Services as of the effective date of this policy will be paid the amount due under this policy as if this policy had been in effect on the date the employee’s Active Duty in the Uniformed Services began.  Payment to any such employee will begin 30 days after the effective date of this policy; however, any payments that would have been due before that commencement date will be paid in a single lump sum 30 days after the effective date of this policy.Application for Reemployment As consideration for providing an employee with this supplemental military pay and the subsidized group health benefits (as described below), Lendlease expects an employee who receives this pay and these benefits to apply for reemployment when his or her military leave ends.Employment Status While on Military Leave An employee receiving supplemental military pay will be placed on “paid military leave of absence greater than 2 weeks” status.  This status in the payroll system will not exceed 18 months.  If an employee’s military leave extends beyond the 18-month period, the employee’s status will be changed to “unpaid leave of absence” status in the payroll system for the remainder of the period during which the employee remains on military leave but not longer than the remainder of the period during which he has reemployment rights required by USERRA (generally 5 years).  If the employee does not return to employment by the applicable deadline provided under the section “Application for Reemployment” below, the employee’s status will be changed to “terminated”, and the employee will have no further reemployment rights. Benefits Change in Status An employee commencing or returning from military leave experiences a change in status and can change his or her elections regarding health and welfare benefits, as permitted under Lendlease’s cafeteria plan documents.During First 30 Days of Military Leave Lendlease will continue all health and welfare benefits for an employee and the employee’s covered dependents based on the same terms and conditions as regular active employees until through the last day of the month coincident with or following the 30th day of the military leave.After First 30 Days of Military Leave (“extended military leave”)Health Benefits The employee, employee’s covered spouse/domestic partner and/or dependents may elect to continue their group health benefits (i.e., medical, dental, vision and EAP coverage) for up to 24 months after these benefits otherwise end, as provided in the prior paragraph.  This coverage is available under both USERRA and COBRA, and the coverage under each will run concurrently.  The employee, the employee’s covered spouse/domestic partner and/or dependents will receive a notice of the opportunity to elect to continue their group health benefits from the COBRA Administrator for the group health benefits.  If the employee, the employee’s covered spouse/domestic partner and/or dependents wish to continue their group health benefits, they will need to elect the coverage by completing an election form and returning it to the COBRA Administrator.The cost of this coverage during the initial 18 months of continuation coverage (or if shorter, the period during which the employee is on military leave for Active Duty in the Uniformed Services) will be the rate paid by similarly-situated active employees for the cost of group health benefits.  For the remaining period of continuation coverage, the cost will be 102% of the total cost of coverage, including both Lendlease’s cost and the employee’s cost.  The payments will be made on an after-tax basis by sending a monthly check to the COBRA Administrator.  The group health benefits will terminate if the payments are not made in a timely manner.Health Care Spending Account A covered employee and his or her spouse and dependents may continue participation in the health care spending account plan for up to 24 months.  This coverage is available under both USERRA and COBRA, and the coverage under each will run concurrently.  The same procedures for electing and paying for the health benefits apply for the continuation of the health care spending account plan, and the payments will be made on an after-tax basis.Dependent Care Spending Account An employee on extended military leave may not make contributions to the Lendlease dependent care spending account plan but may continue to be reimbursed for contributions made to that plan before his extended military leave period, as permitted and limited by the terms of that plan. Other Welfare Benefits Life insurance, AD&D insurance, long term disability insurance, and short term disability insurance provided by Lendlease will be continued at Lendlease’s expense for a period of 12 weeks after the commencement of the employee’s military leave, unless continuation for a longer period is required by state law.  These insured benefits are subject to any exclusions or limitations under the terms of the insurance policies and contracts.Availability of Accrued Time Off An employee on military leave may cash out accrued PTO at any time while on paid or unpaid military leave, at his or her sole election.Other Benefit Accruals An employee will not accrue PTO while on extended military leave.Retirement Plan Benefits An employee’s salary deferrals to the 401(k) plan will end when the employee begins a military leave for a period that is formally scheduled for longer than 2 weeks.  However, an employee with an account in the 401(k) plan may take a loan from the plan while he or she is on military leave.  If an employee has an outstanding participant loan under the 401(k) plan, he or she may continue to make loan payments or may elect for the loan to be held in suspense while he or she is on military leave.  While suspended, the loan will continue to bear interest at the lesser of (i) the rate set under the 401(k) plan, or (ii) the rate specified under the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Relief Act (currently 6%).  At the end of the military leave, the loan will be reamortized, and loan payments must recommence.  Beginning in 2009, to the extent permitted under the 401(k) plan and applicable law, an employee may take a distribution from the 401(k) plan while on military leave. The 401(k) plan and the plan’s loan policy statement provide more detailed terms that control. Reemployment Upon an employee's timely application for reemployment, and depending upon the employee’s period of military service, an employee will be reinstated to employment as described in this section. Retirement Plan Benefits An employee, who becomes reemployed after his or her military leave and who is a participant in the 401(k) plan, will be credited for purposes of eligibility and vesting for the time spent in military service and will be treated as not having incurred a break in service.  Immediately upon reemployment, the employee may, at the employee’s election, make any or all employee contributions (and receive in his or her account any associated Lendlease matching contributions) that the employee would have been eligible to make (or receive) had employment not been interrupted by military service.  The time after reemployment allowed for making up missed contributions cannot exceed the lesser of three times the length of military leave or 5 years.  Upon reemployment, an employee will receive all other company contributions that would have been made to the plan had the employee not taken military leave.  The 401(k) plan provides more detailed terms that control.Welfare Benefits If any of the employee’s welfare benefits terminated during the employee’s leave, the employee may start participating in the welfare benefits upon reemployment without a waiting period and without exclusions, except as permitted under USERRA.Less than 91 Days of Military Service If the employee returns to employment with Lendlease after a period of service in the Uniformed Services of less than 91 days, the employee will be reinstated:
In a position that the employee would have attained if employment had not been interrupted by military service; or
If found not qualified for such position after reasonable efforts by Lendlease, in the position in which the employee had been employed prior to military service.
More than 90 Days and Less than 5 Years of Military ServiceIf the employee returns to employment with Lendlease after a period of service in the Uniformed Services of more than 90 days and less than 5 years, the employee will be reinstated:
In a position that the employee would have attained if employment had not been interrupted by military service or a position of like seniority, status and pay, the duties of which the employee is qualified to perform; or
If found not qualified after reasonable efforts by Lendlease, in the position the employee left, or a position of like seniority, status and pay, the duties of which the employee is qualified to perform.
An Employee with a Service-Connected Disability If after reasonable accommodation efforts by Lendlease an employee with a service-connected disability is not qualified for employment in the position he or she would have attained or in the position that he or she left, the employee will be employed in:Any other position of similar seniority, status and pay for which the employee is qualified or could become qualified with reasonable efforts by  Lendlease; orIf no such position exists, in any other position that is the nearest approximation to the employee’s position before the military service.Exceptions to Reemployment In addition to the employee's failure to apply for reemployment in a timely manner, an employee is not entitled to reinstatement as described above if any of the following conditions exist:Lendlease’s circumstances have so changed as to make reemployment impossible or unreasonable.The employee's employment prior to the military service was merely for a brief, non-recurrent period, and there was no reasonable expectation that the employment would have continued indefinitely or for a significant period.The employee did not receive an honourable discharge from military serviceApplication for Reemployment An employee who has engaged in military service must, in order to be entitled to the reemployment rights set forth above, submit an application for reemployment according to the following schedule, unless the employee has different rights pursuant to applicable state law:

Time or Reason Away from Lendlease

Limitations now apply in Australia when engaging employees on a fixed term contract.  It is important for our business to comply with these changes.

Limitations on using fixed term contracts
In Australia, from 6 December 2023, there are rules (called limitations) about using fixed term contracts after this date. These limitations relate to: 

How long a fixed term contract can be (no longer than 2 years, including extensions and renewals) 
Renewing a fixed term contract, including how many times a contract can be renewed (1 renewal only, and within the 2-year limitation)
Employing a person on consecutive contracts 

Employers will also be required to provide new fixed term employees with a Fixed Term Contract Information Statement from the Fair Work Ombudsman. 
For fixed term contracts entered into before 6 December 2023, the limitations don’t apply, however that contract will need to be considered when applying the consecutive contracts limitation or extending or renewing the contract. 

The new restrictions will not apply where a fixed-term contract:

is for the performance only of a distinct and identifiable task using specialised skills; 
relates to a training agreement (i.e. apprenticeship or traineeship); 
relates to an employee earning more than the high-income threshold (currently $167,500 per annum full-time (noting this figure is adjusted annually on 1 July each year)); 
is for the undertaking of essential work during a peak demand period; 
is for the undertaking of work during emergency circumstances or during a temporary absence of another employee (e.g. a parental leave backfill); 
falls under prescribed government funding exceptions; 
relates to a governance position that has a time limit under the governing rules of a corporation or association of persons; or 
where a modern award permits the term. 

Contact your People & Culture Business Partner, should you wish to seek clarification on whether these limitations apply.

Restructure your team;
Transfer an existing Lendlease employee into your team and/or;

The Lendlease talent review process provides us with a consistent way to talk about our internal talent – whether this is with your peers, management, or across businesses and regions.  This provides greater career progression and development opportunities for our people and helps Lendlease to ensure we have the right people ready for business-critical roles. 

For you as a manager, our talent review process helps you identify the strengths and weaknesses of your team’s capability. It provides you with insights on opportunity, readiness and priorities for people development. 

Simplified Talent Assessment for our Emerging Talent 

In FY24 we have introduced a simplified approach for assessing talent at IC4-6 and PM1-2 (or what we call the “emerging” population).  In this process we ask people managers to assess each of their team members in two ways – potential and performance over time – which combine to give us an overall talent rating. 

Managers will complete this task using a simple drag-and-drop tool in Workday. 

Step 1: assess performance over time. 

Review historical performance ratings for your team member over the past few years.  Have they consistently been rating Ahead of Track, On Track, or Behind Track?  (Click here for more information on our performance framework.) 

Step 2: assess potential. 

Potential is based on the five dimensions of learning agility: mental agility, people agility, change agility, results agility, and self-awareness.  After considering each agility, determine whether your team member’s potential is stable, growth, or high.  (You can read more about each learning agility in this guide.) 

Step 3: provide the overall talent rating. 

Using your assessments of performance over time and potential, assign your team member one of the 9 talent ratings according to the Lendlease 9-box talent grid.  (Review definitions for each of the talent ratings in this guide.)

Out of Town Living (OTL) Allowance is available if you are requested by our business to be on an out-of-town job assignment temporarily relocating you away from your permanent tax home for a period of 90 days or more while on business.

What are the eligibility requirements?
All allowances must be approved in advance through Workday for either a short-term or long-term assignment. Any changes to the authorization form, after approval has been obtained, will require additional approvals. No commitment should be made to an employee or new hire until approvals have been obtained.  Short-term assignment If an employee’s assignment is expected to last 12 months or less, living expenses are not considered taxable income and therefore they would be eligible to receive a ’non-taxable’ OTL allowance.  Long-term assignment If an employee’s assignment is expected to last longer than 12 months, living expenses are considered taxable income and the employee would receive a “taxable” OTL allowance. Assignments too short for OTL allowances Typically an assignment of 90 days or less would not allow for an apartment lease to be established, so the assignment must instead be handled by expenses through accounts payable.  A new Out-of-Town Living Allowance Authorization Form must be completed by the receiving manager each time an employee moves to a new OTL location or begins a new OTL assignment.
How do I apply?

PLAN 

Review the eligibility requirements.Read through the out of town living allowance policy. 

ACT 

Contact your manager, Strategic Business Partner or mobility specialist to discuss your request.

FINALIZE 

Your manager will complete and submit a Workday request with the completed OTL allowance authorization form.An assignment letter will be issued indicating the details of the assignment, including length and amount of monthly OTL.

Development opportunities exist for us all in our current roles, or when planning our next move – whether that be moving up the ladder, pivoting your career focus or keeping your skills contemporary.  Having a Development Plan helps you focus your learning activities to help you deliver on goals set.

Development Planning for People Managers
As a people leader, you are responsible for working with your team to ensure they have a relevant development that aligns with their goals. 
Ideally, you would discuss development plans at Goal Setting time or when a new starter arrives.  You would also revisit the development plan at your regular 1:1 meetings. 
Think about the learning opportunities that might support your whole team, or if individuals have their own unique development needs that you can work on together.
Career Profile
At Lendlease we want to support you and your career development at Lendlease. To be able to support you in having conversations with your manager about how you can reach your full potential, we need to better understand your background – your current skills, your job history and experience, your interests and preferences. One important way to do that is to take just a few minutes to complete your Career Profile in Workday.  The system is easy to navigate and will guide you through several tabs to fill in your information. Helptext is included in the tabs and you can save time by simply uploading your resume. You do not have to complete your career profile in one sitting, Workday will automatically save your progress.

Approver's name and title         Board

Effective Date                24 May 2018

Review DateApril 2018

Next Review Date24 May 2020

Purpose Lendlease is committed to constantly challenging our performance and pushing the boundaries so that our approach to Health and Safety (H&S) is aligned to the evolution of the Lendlease strategy, remains effective and fit for purpose for the sectors and markets in which we operate and positively influences H&S outcomes in everything we do. Scope This Group Policy applies to all Lendlease businesses. This policy applies to employees, consultants and contractors; permanent, fixed-term and casual (Aust only) contracts; full and part-time; salaried, wages (Aust only) or union (US only). This policy applies in all geographies in which Lendlease operates.
Policy In recent times, our aspiration has been to shift our people’s relationship with health, safety and wellbeing from one which is transactional and compliance based towards a more empowering relationship where people are encouraged and supported to use informed judgement and sound risk management techniques.Underlying this focus is the H&S Strategic Direction. This defines the actions and focus of leadership and management in providing effective oversight and management of H&S at all levels across the business in the following areas:Disciplined delivery – supporting the embedment of the Global Minimum Requirements (GMRs) in achieving a more disciplined and consistent delivery model.Strong risk management – transforming people’s relationship with H&S by empowering them to care and manage risk through informed judgement. Driving innovation – utilising the innovation pathway to provide focus and direction to solutions that can positively affect safety outcomes. We also remain committed to ensuring our operations remain focused and engaged and to reviewing the composition of the function to ensure we remain as effective as possible in executing this strategy. Although we operate in a dynamic environment and changes will be made to enhance our strategy, the H&S Strategic Direction is resolute and focused in these areas.Achieving this aspiration relies on the implementation of a simple and effective framework that assists our day-to-day decision making and helps our business function safely. Our 2015 GMRs drive this approach across five stages of the operational lifecycle. These include governance, investment, design and planning, establishing work environments and delivery, setting parameters on the control and elimination of key risk events faced by our business. There is a deliberate focus on front-end planning and strong risk management meaning that safety begins for Lendlease well before a project commences and irrespective of the working environment. The H&S Strategic Direction and GMR Framework are essential components in ensuring the safety, health and wellbeing of our people remains our priority. This approach also empowers people to identify and manage H&S risks that are applicable to them, promotes moving beyond minimum statutory and organisational requirements, and leads to innovation and continual improvement. They are all key attributes in our aspiration to create places that care and which are free from incident and injury. Definitions GMRs Global Minimum Requirements – our safety framework.Further information and related materials Download a copy of this Health & Safety Policy H&S Microsite - this part of our intranet will provide you with further information on our approach to Health and Safety, including our GMRs.

The People's Pension is a workplace pension scheme operated by B&CE. The Scheme has been chosen by Lendlease to support the Government initiative 'Automatic Enrolment' (AE), aimed at helping workers to save more for their retirement. 
The initiative requires Lendlease to automatically enroll you into a qualifying pension scheme if you are not already in one, provided you meet the eligibility criteria:

What are the eligibility requirements?
Members of the People's Pension have been automatically enrolled by the Company because they have not opted in to the Lendlease UK Pension Scheme and meet the criteria for AE or have chosen to join.

Company Contribution

2% of your base salary

Employee Contribution

1% of your base salary 

Total = 3% of your base salary paid directly into your pension account

The deductions will be taken monthly from your salary by salary sacrifice meaning that you will receive tax and national insurance relief on your contribution at the highest rate you pay.
Charges
Investment charges apply to your pension account and, the current rate is 0.5% of the value of your account which equates to 50 pence per year for every £100 invested.
Your pension at retirement is based on the contributions paid in and investment return. You can visit the People's Pension website for further information on how the scheme works. 
What are the benefits of the People's Pension?
As a member of the People's Pension Scheme you can benefit from:
• Tax relief at your highest marginal rate and pay no National Insurance on contributions. • The option to increase your own personal contributions by making regular monthly Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVC’s) • Take up to 25% of your pension as a tax free lump sum • Your own pension account, where you can view and manage your account online • Annual online benefit statements on the performance of your account and potential income at retirement • Access to tools to help you plan for your future • Opt to transfer your pension to another registered pension arrangement when you leave Lendlease or continue to participate in the People's Pension

Group People & Culture

Approver's name and title:Alex Christie,Global Head of People & Culture        

Effective date:January 2016

Approval date:January 2020

Next review date:                            January 2022

PURPOSE
Lendlease is committed to creating the best places and to create the best places, we need to ensure we have the best people who can honour our goals and values. The objective of the employment screening process is to ensure the integrity, identity and credentials of employees. Employment screening helps to address a range of employee related risks, such as internal fraud and money laundering and a candidate’s suitability for a role.
Effective employment screening helps to enable Lendlease to make prudent decisions on hiring, promotions and changes of duties that are based on an informed understanding of an individual’s background and credentials. Screening also helps to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements.
SCOPE
This Group Policy applies to all employees in all locations and in particular applies to:

Executives - all new hires and internal transfers or promotions into Executive roles;
Specified Roles - all new hires and internal transfers into Specified Roles;
Retirement Living  - all new hires and transfers within the business; and Prospective and current employees may be subject to Medical Screening where appropriate
all new hires and transfers into a role which is subject to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) legislation.

Dependent on the nature of the work being completed with Lendlease, it may be appropriate for contractors and/or sub-contractors in some regions to be subject to screening under this policy.
POLICY
When to conduct screening
Screening must be completed prior to employment/engagement starting (“commencement”). The Regional Head of People & Culture can provide an exception to commence prior to completion of screening. If an adverse employment screening check is returned post the hiring of an employee, Lendlease reserves the right to terminate employment.
An internal transfer or appointment into a Specified Role from a non-specified role or a promotion to an Executive position will require additional screening and must be completed before the employee transfers into the Specified Role or is promoted into the Executive position.
The requirement to complete any employment assessment must be clearly stated within the position advertisement, job description form and/or application form as a pre-requisite for employment consideration. The consent of the prospective employee must be obtained before conducting pre-employment screening by signing the applicant’s declaration (part 2) of the Pre-Employment Medical Assessment paperwork.
Medical Screening

Employment medicals may be used to screen prospective and existing employees for any medical, mental health conditions or physical capabilities to assess their ability to perform the inherent requirements of the role.
Screening of employees may be warranted based on the nature of the work, or area within which the work is to be performed e.g. manual handling duties.
Screening should be conducted in a manner that is fair and consistent, ensuring compliance with employment legislation, and State and Federal equal opportunity and anti-discrimination legislation.
Prospective employees may be assessed as unsuitable on medical grounds where a pre-existing medical condition, or effects of ongoing medication, will prevent the prospective employee from being able to carry out the inherent requirements of the position.

Re-screening
All employees of the Retirement Living business are required to be screened as per the relevant Aged Care legislation including pre-employment and during employment. 
Base level screening
Lendlease’s base level screening includes a range of checks designed to verify the applicant's identity, their technical capabilities, work history,  probity and active criminal history. It covers the personal and technical elements which collectively represent a person's integrity.Impacted applicants are required to undergo Base Level Screening which includes:

identity and work eligibility checks
confirmation of background and qualifications
criminal history screening

Base Level Screening will aim to:

confirm the accuracy of the applicant's background and qualifications
confirm the probity of the applicant

Additional screening, above Base Level Screening (i.e. additional components), is required for applicants being considered for a Specified Role or an Executive position. Additional screening may consist of but not be limited to financial regulatory checks, shareholder and directorship checks.
Responsibilities
People Connect, Resourcing and/or Strategic Business Partners - People & Culture (in countries that are not supported by People Connect) coordinate the screening:

booking appropriate screening services from the vendor,
ensuring all documentation has been forwarded to the appropriate vendor,
ensuring that private and confidential information is satisfactorily managed.

People Connect are responsible for monitoring adherence to this policy, in particular to manage the relationships with external vendors of screening services, reporting to businesses and advising  Strategic Business Partners - People & Culture and the Hiring Manager on screening issues.
Screening Issues and allowable exceptions
Employment screening cannot be waived for in-scope employees; however, there is an allowable exception to policy namely:

As part of an acquisition whereby negotiated terms may exclude the screening of acquired employees for those who have already satisfied Lendlease's screening components

With respect to a business acquisition, the relevant General Manager, People & Culture and other stakeholders involved in the acquisition/tender process must ensure that the acquired business employees who will become Lendlease employees have satisfied Lendlease’s screening requirement. If not, acquired employees who fall within the scope of this policy are required to be screened. Addressing screening during an acquisition should be considered as part of the acquisition/tender process and managed comprehensively as part of the business integration process (on a case-by-case basis).
Discrepancies
Any discrepancies identified by the screening process must be considered by the Hiring Manager in conjunction with the relevant General Manager, People & Culture for the business in accordance with the Employment Screening Review Guidelines and Actions document that is available to the General Manager, People & Culture for each business. Any discrepancies between the results of screening and information disclosed by an applicant should be considered on a case by case basis, taking into account:

all of the circumstances including the context, relevance and seriousness of the inconsistency;
whether Lendlease was misled in relation to the discrepancy; and
whether the discrepancy impacts the applicant's capacity to perform the inherent requirements of the role (e.g. undisclosed criminal record would be considered far more material than a minor error in employment dates).

If a criminal history screening returns a disclosable court outcome, the General Manager, People & Culture in conjunction with the Business CEO will decide whether further action is required. This may include the withdrawal of an offer of employment/engagement or the termination of the employment/engagement.
Criminal Checks (UK) In the United Kingdom, regulations have been established by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) with a view to better safeguarding the environments in which children or vulnerable persons are located. They are intended to provide information to help inform recruitment and employee project placement decisions.
Mandatory checks are undertaken for employees, contractors, agency workers and subcontractors who have been identified by the business as satisfying the Lendlease criminal checks criteria.
An appropriate record of results of discrepancy inquiries is to be maintained by People Connect.
Consequences of breaching this policy
Disciplinary action may be taken at Lendlease’s sole discretion if this policy is breached. This may include action up to and including dismissal in appropriate circumstances.
DEFINITIONS
Applicant - An existing Lendlease employee or external candidate applying for a position of employment

Generally, a candidate should participate in two rounds of interview for the role, excluding an initial phone discussion with the recruiter and any pre-offer assessments. The interviews should be panel based and focus on technical fit, cultural fit and/or leadership fit.  Offers will be made in-line with the CJF salary band and/ or budget allocated for the position. Managers should consult with their People & Culture Representative should they have any questions regarding the salary budgets or packaging options.To ensure there is no unnecessary cost to Lendlease or misrepresentation of our organisation, you should speak with your Talent Acquisition Partner before engaging recruitment agencies.

Interview Techniques
The initial screening of the candidates will be primarily led by the Talent Acquisition Partner. During the recruitment process People Leaders are coached by Talent Acquisition Partner on best practice interview techniques which are aligned to Lendlease Strategy, Key Principles and Core Values. Jointly, the hiring managers and the Talent Acquisition Partner will develop a Recruitment Action Plan which will detail the planned recruitment approach and design for the interview process.There is a Quick Reference Guide on Interview Tips available on the Recruitment Portal.

As a people manager at Lendlease it is important you understand your authority and accountability in relation to people management processes and take responsibility for your decisions.
Our People & Culture people manager approvals guidelines ensure that approvals are made at the right level and provides governance and controls around people management processes.
They address commercially based decisions in relation to:-

Recruitment (request to hire and offer management)
Compensation related requests (including education assistance)
Employee leave
Employee job changes
Employees separation (employees leaving Lendlease)
Performance reviews
Training approval

What can I approve?
Your Career and Job Framework (CJF) job level will determine your span of authority and accountability for decision making in relation to all people management decisions including the extent to which you have the authority to approve people related requests/impacts.If you are unsure of your CJF job level you can find this information in your profile on Workday.Approvals for people management processes include two categories: - Approvals with a compensation or significant cost component. - Approvals that do not have a direct or a significant cost component.Approvals are typically ‘one-up’ (your manager approves), or ‘two-up’ (both your manager and their manager approves) and follow the manager’s reporting line. However, when a process has a compensation or significant cost component, the process may also have a 'Limit of Authority' associated with it.
What are the P&C Limits of Authority?
Lendlease Limits of Authority (LOA) define financial parameters associated with a process or request. When a request exceeds the financial parameters defined for the process LOA approval will be sought in addition to the ‘one-up’ or ‘two-up’ manager.For example, recruitment will typically require approval by the requestor’s ‘one-up’ and ‘two-up’ manager. However, when the salary requested is outside of the CJF salary range for the role further approval is required by the Regional Head of P&C.
Where do I go to approve requests?
In most cases requests are approved within Workday.

If you are considering an international career move, you need to investigate your right to work in the country or countries you are interested in and your eligibility for relocation assistance.

What are the right to work and visa requirements?
Some countries have very specific requirements that dictate whether or not you will be able to work there. Your ability to secure a right to work will depend on a number of things including the type of work, citizenship and qualifications.These regulations are strictly governed by national departments with responsibility for immigration and border protection and we take these very seriously as they could impact our ability to run operations in a country.  We recommend you refer to the relevant national government’s visa information pages. 
Do I receive relocation assistance?
Relocation assistance does not apply to all roles and is dependent on individual circumstances and affordability to the business. Details of a relocation package will be discussed at the time of offer. To provide an understanding of what that assistance could look like, refer to the Global Mobility Framework.As a minimum we will support you with advice about the visa application process; the costs associated with your visa application; advice about the tax implications of moving to the new location; and, settling into the new location for the first few weeks.

Americas People & Culture
PURPOSE Lendlease will comply with the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) implementing Regulations as revised effective February 2013.  The company posts the mandatory FMLA Notice in the company break rooms and upon hire provides all new employees with notices required by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) on Employee Rights and Responsibilities under the Family and Medical Leave Act.The function of this policy is to provide employees with a general description of their Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) rights.  In the event of any conflict between this policy and the applicable law, employees will be afforded all rights required by law under the Family and Medical Leave Act by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). If you have any questions regarding this policy, you must contact The Hartford at 888.301.5615 or online at www.abilityadvantage.thehartford.com SCOPE Under this policy, Lendlease (“The Company”) will grant up to 12 weeks (or up to 26 weeks of military caregiver leave to care for a covered service-member with a serious injury or illness) during a 12-month period to eligible employees. The leave may be paid, unpaid or a combination of paid and unpaid leave, depending on the circumstances of the leave and as specified in this policy.ELIGIBILITY To qualify to take family or medical leave under this policy, the employee must meet all of the following conditions:
1. The employee must have worked for the company for 12 months or 52 weeks. The 12 months or 52 weeks need not have been consecutive. Separate periods of employment will be counted, provided that the break in service does not exceed seven years. Separate periods of employment will be counted if the break in service exceeds seven years due to National Guard or Reserve military service obligations or when there is a written agreement, including a collective bargaining agreement, stating the employer’s intention to rehire the employee after the service break. For eligibility purposes, an employee will be considered to have been employed for an entire week even if the employee was on the payroll for only part of a week or if the employee is on leave during the week.
2. The employee must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately before the date when the leave is requested to commence. The principles established under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) determine the number of hours worked by an employee. The FLSA does not include time spent on paid or unpaid leave as hours worked. Consequently, these hours of leave should not be counted in determining the 1,250 hours eligibility test for an employee under FMLA. Airline flight crewmembers or flight attendants will meet the FMLA hours of service eligibility requirement if he or she has worked or been paid for not less than 60 percent of the applicable total monthly guarantee (or its equivalent) and has worked or been paid for not less than 504 hours (not including personal commute time or time spent on vacation, medical, or sick leave) during the previous 12 months. Airline employees who are not flight crew employees continue to be covered under the general hour of service eligibility requirement which requires 1,250 hours of service in the previous 12 months.
3. The employee must work in a worksite where 50 or more employees are employed by the company within 75 miles of that office or worksite. The distance is to be calculated by using available transportation by the most direct route.
POLICY Types of Leave Covered To qualify as FMLA leave under this policy, the employee must be taking leave for one of the reasons listed below:
1. The birth of a child and in order to care for that child.
2. The placement of a child for adoption or foster care and to care for the newly placed child.
3. To care for a spouse/domestic partner, child or parent with a serious health condition (described below).The definition of "spouse" includes marriages legally entered into by same-sex couples.
4. The serious health condition (described below) of the employee. The serious health condition (described below) of the employee, spouse/domestic partner, child(ren) or parent(s).An employee may take leave because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's position.A serious health condition is defined as a condition that requires inpatient care at a hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility, including any period of incapacity or any subsequent treatment in connection with such inpatient care or a condition that requires continuing care by a licensed health care provider.This policy covers illnesses of a serious and long-term nature, resulting in recurring or lengthy absences. Generally, a health condition that would result in a period of three consecutive days of incapacity with the first visit to the health care provider within seven days of the onset of the incapacity and a second visit within 30 days of the incapacity would be considered a serious health condition. for a chronic or long-term health conditions requires periodic health care visits for treatment at least twice a year.Employees with questions about what illnesses are covered under this FMLA policy are encouraged to consult with The Hartford.
5. Qualifying exigency leave for families of members of the National Guard or Reserves or of a regular component of the Armed Forces when the covered military member is on covered active duty or called to covered active duty.An employee whose spouse/domestic partner, son, daughter or parent either has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active military duty or who is already on covered active duty may take up to 12 weeks of leave for reasons related to or affected by the family member’s call-up or service. The qualifying exigency must be one of the following:- short-notice deployment,- military events and activities,- child care and school activities,- financial and legal arrangements,- counseling,- rest and recuperation,- post-deployment activities and- additional activities that arise out of active duty, provided that the employer and employee agree, including agreement on timing and duration of the leave.“Covered active duty” means:(a)in the case of a member of a regular component of the Armed Forces, duty during the deployment of the member with the Armed Forces to a foreign country; and(b)in the case of a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces, duty during the deployment of the member with the Armed Forces to a foreign country under a call or order to active duty under a provision of law referred to in section 101(a)(13)(B) of title 10, United States Code.The leave may commence as soon as the individual receives the call-up notice (Son or daughter for this type of FMLA leave is defined the same as for child for other types of FMLA leave except that the person does not have to be a minor.) This type of leave would be counted toward the employee’s 12-week maximum of FMLA leave in a 12-month period.
6. Military caregiver leave (also known as covered service-member leave) to care for an injured or ill service-member or veteran.An employee whose son, daughter, parent or next of kin is a covered service-member may take up to 26 weeks in a single 12-month period to take care of leave to care for that service-member.Next of kin is defined as the closest blood relative of the injured or recovering service-member.The term “covered service-member” means:(a) a member of the Armed Forces (including a member of the National Guard or Reserves) who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness; or(b) a veteran who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, for a serious injury or illness and who was a member of the Armed Forces (including a member of the National Guard or Reserves) at any time during the period of 5 years preceding the date on which the veteran undergoes that medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy.The term “serious injury or illness”:(a) in the case of a member of the Armed Forces (including a member of the National Guard or Reserves), means an injury or illness that was incurred by the member in line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces (or existed before the beginning of the member’s active duty and was aggravated by service in line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces) and that may render the member medically unfit to perform the duties of the member’s office, grade, rank, or rating; and(b) in the case of a veteran who was a member of the Armed Forces (including a member of the National Guard or Reserves) at any time during a period when the person was a covered service-member, means a qualifying (as defined by the Secretary of Labor) injury or illness that was incurred by the member in line of duty on an active duty in the Armed Forces (or existed before the beginning of the member’s active duty and was aggravated by service in line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces) and that manifested itself before or after the member became a veteran.
Amount of Leave Covered An eligible employee can take up to 12 weeks for the FMLA circumstances (1) through (5) above under this policy during any 12-month period. The company will measure the 12-month period as a rolling 12-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses any leave under this policy. Each time an employee takes leave, the company will compute the amount of leave the employee has taken under this policy in the last 12 months and subtract it from the 12 weeks of available leave, and the balance remaining is the amount the employee is entitled to take at that time.An eligible employee can take up to 26 weeks for the FMLA circumstance (6) above (military caregiver leave) during a single 12-month period. For this military caregiver leave, the company will measure the 12-month period as a rolling 12-month period measured forward. FMLA leave already taken for other FMLA circumstances will be deducted from the total of 26 weeks available.
If an employee and spouse/domestic partner both work for the company and each wishes to take leave for the birth of a child, adoption or placement of a child in foster care, or to care for a parent (but not a parent "in-law") with a serious health condition, the employee and spouse/domestic partner may only take a combined total of 12 weeks of leave. If the employee and spouse/domestic partner both work for the company and each wishes to take leave to care for a covered injured or ill service-member, the employee and spouse/domestic partner may only take a combined total of 26 weeks of leave.
Employee Status and Benefits during Leave While an employee is on leave, the company will continue the employee's health benefits during the leave period at the same level and under the same conditions as if the employee had continued to work.If the employee chooses not to return to work for reasons other than a continued serious health condition of the employee or the employee's family member or a circumstance beyond the employee's control, the company will require the employee to reimburse the company the amount it paid for the employee's health insurance premium during the leave period.Under current company policy, the employee pays a portion of the health care premium. While on paid leave, the employer will continue to make payroll deductions to collect the employee's share of the premium. While on unpaid leave, the employee must continue to make this payment, either in person or by mail. The payment must be received in the Benefits Department by the due date provided on the insurance coupon vouchers. If the payment is more than 30 days late, the employee's health care coverage may be dropped for the duration of the leave. The employer will provide 15 days' notification prior to the employee's loss of coverage.If the employee contributes to a life insurance or disability plan, the employer will continue making payroll deductions while the employee is on paid leave. While the employee is on unpaid leave, the employee may request continuation of such benefits and pay his or her portion of the premiums, or the employer may elect to maintain such benefits during the leave and pay the employee's share of the premium payments. If the employee does not continue these payments, the employer may discontinue coverage during the leave. If the employer maintains coverage, the employer may recover the costs incurred for paying the employee's share of any premiums, whether or not the employee returns to work.Employee Status after Leave An employee who takes leave under this policy may be asked to provide a fitness for duty (FFD) clearance from the health care provider. This requirement will be included in The Hartford's response to the FMLA request. Generally, an employee who takes FMLA leave will be able to return to the same position or a position with equivalent status, pay, benefits and other employment terms. The position will be the same or one which is virtually identical in terms of pay, benefits and working conditions. In certain instances, Lend Lease may choose to exempt certain key employees from this requirement and not return them to the same or similar position.Use of Paid and Unpaid Leave An employee who is taking FMLA leave because of the employee's own serious health condition, FML will run concurrently with short-term disability.  If the FMLA leave is for the serious health condition of a family member the employee can substitute paid time off (PTO).Disability leave for the birth of the child and for an employee's serious health condition, including workers' compensation leave (to the extent that it qualifies), will be designated as FMLA leave and will run concurrently with FMLA. For example, if an employer provides six weeks of pregnancy disability leave, the six weeks will be designated as FMLA leave and counted toward the employee's 12-week entitlement. The employee has the option to substitute accrued (or earned) PTO as appropriate before being eligible for unpaid leave for what remains of the 12-week entitlement. This same option applies to an employee who is taking leave for the adoption or foster care of a child.
In order to receive holiday pay, an employee must either work or use a PTO day on the last business day before and on the first business day after a holiday. If an employee is on an FMLA leave and is using his or her accrued PTO on the last business day before and on the first business day after the holiday during the FMLA leave period in which the holiday falls, the employee will receive holiday pay for the holiday.  If an employee is on an unpaid FMLA leave during the period on which the holiday falls, then the employee will not be paid for the holiday that occurs during the leave.
An employee will receive payment of short-term disability (“STD”) benefits during his or her leave period, including on the holiday that occurs during the leave period, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Company’s short-term disability program.  An employee who is using military FMLA leave for a qualifying exigency or FMLA military caregiver leave has the option to substitute accrued (or earned) PTO as appropriate before being eligible for unpaid leave.Intermittent Leave or a Reduced Work Schedule The employee may take FMLA leave in 12 consecutive weeks, may use the leave intermittently (take a day periodically when needed over the year) or, under certain circumstances, may use the leave to reduce the workweek or workday, resulting in a reduced hour schedule. In all cases, the leave may not exceed a total of 12 workweeks (or 26 workweeks to care for an injured or ill servicemember over a 12-month period).The company may temporarily transfer an employee to an available alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits if the alternative position would better accommodate the intermittent or reduced schedule, in instances of when leave for the employee or employee's family member is foreseeable and for planned medical treatment, including recovery from a serious health condition or to care for a child after birth, or placement for adoption or foster care.For the birth, adoption or foster care of a child, the company and the employee must mutually agree to the schedule before the employee may take the leave intermittently or work a reduced hour schedule. Leave for birth, adoption or foster care of a child must be taken within one year of the birth or placement of the child.
If the employee is taking leave for a serious health condition or because of the serious health condition of a spouse/domestic partner, child(ren) or parent(s), the employee should try to reach agreement with the company before taking intermittent leave or working a reduced hour schedule. If this is not possible, then the employee must prove that the use of the leave is medically necessary.

COVID-19 has brought about many changes in our lives, including the way we work.
Restricted movement has prompted an increase in remote working globally. Lendlease has long supported flexible working and regularly adopts new approaches as technology and the ways in which we work evolve. 

The business, now embracing hybrid working as the norm, is generating fresh options for when and where people work provided they are prioritising customers, their teams and then themselves.  

To further support this culture shift, a new flex opportunity is being offered for those interested in blending short-term remote working with annual leave overseas to extend their trips and spend time with family overseas.  

There are a number of risks and challenges associated with International Remote Working (IRW). To ensure that Lendlease is compliant with local immigration and tax regulations, it is important that the IRW Guidelines are reviewed and adhered to before any remote working arrangements are approved.

Approver's name and title:
Teena HesterHead of People & Culture, Americas

Effective date:
August 2017

Review date:
August 2017

Next review date:
August 2019

PURPOSE & ELIGIBILITY The purpose of the Out of Town Living Allowance is to cover significant duplicate living costs arising from being put on an Out of Town Living Assignment.Employees are eligible for an Out of Town Living Allowance if they are requested by the company to be on an out-of-town job assignment temporarily relocating them more than 50 miles away from their permanent tax home for a period of 120 days or more while on company business. OTL Allowances must be approved through Workday Job Change, Promotion or Offer, before it is able to be paid.POLICY Assignment Length & Taxability The assignment length should be based on the legitimate expected length of assignment on the project and updated at the point this intent changes. (For example, if 5 months into an 8-month assignment the project decides an employee will be there a total of 14 months, project management should notify People & Culture to extend the assignment and the OTL would become taxable at that time.) 
Short-term Assignment - If an employee’s assignment is expected to last twelve (12) months or less, living expenses are not taxable income to the employee and therefore he/she would be eligible to receive a “non-taxable” OTL allowance. All reimbursements for Home Leave travel will also be non-taxable.Long-term Assignment - If an employee’s assignment is expected to last longer than twelve (12) months, living expenses are taxable income to the employee and he/she would receive a “taxable” OTL allowance. In this case, there will be a gross up for taxes by payroll beginning from the first month of the assignment. All reimbursements for Home Leave travel will also be taxable and passed along form Accounts Payable to be grossed up for taxes and paid through Payroll.Assignments that are too Short for OTL Allowances- In most situations an assignment of 120 days or less would not allow for an apartment lease to be established, so the assignment must be handled by expenses through Accounts Payable. In these situations, a Job Change in Workday is still typically required to place the employee in the correct work state for taxes.
Typically, a Workday Job Change will be required if the employee will be working at a project location for 6 weeks or more. Also, the employee should be working approximately 100% of their time at the OTL location during the expected assignment. If there is a question around this Payroll and/or the Mobility Specialist should be contacted.
Required Pre-Approval All Out of Town Living Allowances must be approved, in advance, through the Appian system.  A Manager should attach completed versions of the OTL Authorization Form AND the Declaration of OTL Benefits Form to the Appian Job Change, Promotion or Offer. If these documents are not attached, the Appian action will be rejected until they are attached. Any changes, including expected duration dates, to the authorization form after approval have been obtained will require additional approvals.  No commitment should be made to an employee or new hire until Appian approvals have been obtained.A new OTL Allowance Authorization Form and Declaration of OTL Benefits must be completed each time an employee moves to a new OTL assignment. OTL Allowance Rate The Standard Net Monthly Rates will be established based on reimbursement for:

Apartment rental (one-bedroom)
Basic furniture rental
Utilities – electricity, gas, water, standard cable television & internet
Incidentals (including, but not limited to, dry cleaning & groceries) are handled by $300 included within the Standard Established Monthly OTL Rate
Security Deposits are not typically covered by Lend Lease, as these will be reimbursed to the employee
The employee should match any lease they enter to the terms of their assignment. If Lend Lease changes the OTL assignment details and causes lease break costs, these will be reimbursed to the employee.
Certain non-reimbursable fees such as apartment application fee or background check, may be reimbursed individually.

Other factors that may affect the baseline rate should also be considered such as length of stay, housing alternatives, lower cost areas in close proximity.Setting OTL Allowance Rate Upon request by a project or management group, People & Culture will work with a contracted third party vendor to determine the OTL rate for a particular city or geographic area. From the vendor information, a standard monthly net rate which includes the $300 for incidentals per month will be determined. Once a rate is established for a geographic location, this rate must be paid consistently among all eligible employees’ working in that location.The rates paid will be reviewed as needed to ensure they remain current with market conditions for the affected area.Items Not Included in the OTL Rate
Meals - Meals are not included in the OTL rate structure. Only business meals will be reimbursed using the actual expense method submitted on the Employee Expense Reports Form when appropriate.
Transportation for Home Leave Trips - Actual expenses for transportation for one round trip to the employee’s home per month will be reimbursed and should be submitted on the Employee Expense Report Form. Additional home leave trips may be approved by Management, but are not required by OTL Policy.

The Lendlease 401(k) Plan is our employer-sponsored retirement savings plan offered to our US employees. The plan is administered by Vanguard® and lets you save directly through payroll deductions and invest your contributions on a pre-tax, Roth or traditional after-tax basis.

What are the eligibility requirements?
All full-time, salaried US employees are eligible to participate, including Lendlease international transfers (excludes inbound international assignees on secondments).To enroll in the Lendlease 401(k) Plan, you must be a new employee or an existing employee who has not yet enrolled in the Lendlease 401 (k) Plan.New employees can enroll soon after hire, or will be automatically enrolled in the program approximately 90 days after start date unless they contact Vanguard to opt out. 
What are the benefits?
The plan offers a number of additional benefits that can be activated via the Vanguard website:Annual Increase If elected, the ‘annual increase’ option allows you to increase the amount you are saving by gradually increasing your contribution rate over time. Each year your savings rate is raised by the percentage you specify. Annual increases take place until you've reached the IRS or your plan's saving limit. Check your plan for ‘one step save’ details by accessing your account online or calling Vanguard.One-time additional payment or pay off your existing 401(k) loan balance You can make a payment over and above your normal payroll deduction and it will be applied toward your principle balance. You will need to log onto your account online then click ‘manage loans/withdrawals’ under the ’I want to...’ drop down menu. You will see your loan(s) listed. You can then complete an electronic bank transfer for part or your entire loan by clicking ‘initiate payoff or early payment’. This cannot be handled by payroll deduction.Company matching The company match is a simple way to maximize your plan contributions. After one year of service, for every $1 you contribute to the plan (either pre-tax or Roth, or a combination of both), Lendlease will contribute $0.50, up to 6% of your eligible compensation.Maximize the company match If you plan to contribute the full IRS dollar limit of $22,500 to your 401(k) Plan in 2023, there is potential for you to miss some company matching contributions if you ‘max out’ before the end of the year. Use the contribution maximizer calculator to help you understand the contribution percentage to best maximize your company matching contributions. If you are 50 years or older, or turn 50 anytime during the year, you are eligible to contribute an additional $7,500, up to $30,000, as catch-up for retirement.  If you were previously employed by Lendlease, contact People Connect to enquire about your eligibility for company match.

Occasionally our employees may be asked to perform tasks that are beyond the normal scope of their role requiring time away from their usual place of work, or working in excess of their usual working days. At Lendlease we understand that fulfilling these requests can result in the employee incurring additional costs associated with caring for their dependents. The Dependent Care Rebate assists eligible employees by reimbursing part of the cost involved in organising an approved or registered carer to care for their dependent/s in their home.

What are the eligibility requirements?
Permanent and fixed-term employees of Lendlease are eligible for the Dependent Care Rebate, subject to policy conditions.Individuals employed under the terms and conditions of an operative enterprise agreement with a Lendlease group company, should refer to the relevant enterprise agreement to determine if this policy applies to you.

Term

Definition 

Dependent  

A dependent is considered to be an immediate family member including partner, spouse, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, brother, sister, step-parent, step-child, step-sister, step-brother, fiancé or fiancée. It may also include your partner’s immediate family or another person living with you as part of your family. Partner is one of two people in a marriage or de facto relationship, including those in same-sex relationships. 

Approved Childcare

Childcare provided by an approved service including centre-based long day care service, family day care service, occasional care service, in home care and some occasional-care services.Please go to the website www.humanservices.gov.au for more information.

Full Term Employee 

An employee engaged on a permanent basis to work full time hours. 

Part Term Employee 

An employee engaged on a permanent basis to work regular hours that are less than full time hours. 

Employees can claim the rebate in situations where they are required by the business to undertake work commitments resulting in additional dependent care costs being incurred. This may occur due to a temporary planned event, or an unplanned event.Planned Fulfilling temporary/ ad-hoc requests beyond the normal scope of the role (e.g. a part time employee is required to work an additional day, or an employee is required to travel interstate where this is not a normal requirement of their role). For example, John is a Finance Manager based in Adelaide and has been asked by his manager to travel to Sydney to attend a two day seminar. John is a single parent and the primary caregiver for his two children and is unable to arrange alternative childcare arrangements whilst he is away. In this situation, John could arrange for an approved or registered carer to care for his children in their home during the hours he would normally care for them (6pm to 7am), and claim a subsidy under the Dependent Care Rebate.  Emergency/ Unplanned - Working additional hours at the request of the Company - Breakdown in travel arrangements (e.g. delayed flight)For example, Lisa’s manager asks her if she is able to stay back until 10pm to finalise a bid. Lisa normally finishes work at 5pm and gets home at 5.30pm to care for her very elderly mother of whom she is the primary carer. Lisa says that this will be ok, but needs to make alternative carer arrangements for her mother (through a registered carer). In this situation, Lisa is able to claim a subsidy under the Dependent Care Rebate for the hours where she would normally be the primary caregiver of her mother (5.30pm – 10pm).

Strategic Working Plans (SWP) are owned by the Business Leader with People & Culture and Finance executive partnership. SWP comprise two interdependent activities. It is both a risk management tool that informs decision making, and a means of optimising workforce effectiveness now and well into the future.  The Workforce Strategy enables Businesses to model, articulate and shape the workforce of the future (3-5 years out). The Workforce Strategy is informed by and informs the Business Plan and considers future labour supply and costs; organisation and team design; the impact of technology disruptors on existing and future required capabilities.  Approaches to develop or securing the future capability are identified with strategic action plans documented. The action plans in turn inform the operational Full Time Equivalent (FTE) Planning  process, which is largely decentralised. It is important that the contributors understand the Strategic Workforce actions for the plan period.Each year the business sets an Operational Budget which includes employment costs based on the forecasted resourcing needs for that year. The Operational Plans are prepared annually and forecast the required FTE and expected cost impacts.  The forecasted FTE are expanded to the Career and Job Framework (CJF) Job Family and Role level FTE forecasts and captured at a business unit level, providing insight to how the workforce is developing against the plan.To ensure financial targets are not impacted, managers should reference their operational FTE plans prior to approving new positions, promotions or job changes that will have an impact to employment costs. Your finance partner will be able to provide additional information if required.

At Lendlease when an employee leaves our organisation it is called a “termination”. 
When a termination is sensitive or complex, your Strategic Business Partner will review the process and form, and will work with you to make sure you are properly supported and the correct policies and legal procedures are followed.Voluntary terminations are employee initiated with common reasons being:    • Resignation    • Retirement    • Not returning from a period of leaveInvoluntary terminations are when the business decides to end the employment contract. Common reasons are:    • Redundancy    • Misconduct    • Unresolved performance issuesStrategic Business Partners should be consulted on all involuntary terminations.

How do I initiate a Termination?

 PLAN 
If the termination is due to a resignation you will need to have a resignation letter from the employee to finalise the termination process (this can be in the form of an email). A resignation letter is not required in the Americas region.For all other types of termination, please check Lendlease policy and any other specific legislative requirements which will determine what documentation is required and when.You will also need to establish:- Is the notice period agreed the standard contractual notice?- What date is the employee’s last working day?- Is the employee’s last working day the same as their end date?- What handover is required for the employee’s work?- What assets does the employee have? When and how will they be returned to the business?- Will the employee be changing their address in the near future?

 PREPARE 
Together with the employee, finalise and agree on the terms of the termination.   

 ACT

For voluntary resignations the employee or manager can enter the termination in Workday. Please refer to the Quick Fact Guide for more information.
For involuntary resignations the Strategic Business Partner will enter the termination record in Workday.
If you have any questions on this process please contact People Connect.

 FINALISE

In some instances, approval may be required in line with the Limits of Authority.

Notice Periods
Notice periods are dependent on the terms and conditions in an employee’s contract of employment and can vary. Leaders should contact their Strategic Business Partner to confirm the notice periods for their employees.Notice periods do not apply for United States employees

 Quick Facts - Termination Process

FAQ

Q - What does the Strategic Business Partner review?A - When an employee termination is complex or especially sensitive, your Strategic Business Partner is required to review the termination details. In some cases, specific legislation or policy determines how and under what terms an employee should leave e.g. in cases of redundancy, performance related dismissals or separations due to ill health. It is the responsibility of your Strategic Business Partner to support you and sometimes take the lead in these circumstances.

PURPOSE Summer Hours Program is designed to help you maximize and enjoy your time during the summer season as well as promote a work-life balance.SCOPE All Lendlease US based employees with Manager approval.POLICY How the Summer Hours Program Works If you choose to work four additional hours on Monday through Thursday of a given week, you can take a half day after working 4 hours on Friday of that week.  For example, if you work four additional hours on Monday through Thursday and your workday begins at 8:00 AM on Friday, you would be able to leave at Noon.This flexible schedule program, which is dependent on business needs and approval from your manager, will be available from June through August. Employees will be able to participate in this program every other week dependant on the schedule you manager creates for your work group. Alternating weeks with your colleagues will allow for effective coverage and prevent disruption to work.Generally, our standard hours are from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM with one hour for lunch. All employees are expected to be at work during these hours. During the Summer Hours Program, the time of arrival and departure may not differ from the standard hours by more than two hours except for Friday at early departure. For example, if you work three additional hours Monday through Thursday, you may leave at 2:00 on Friday. Employees must work a minimum of 4 hours on Friday.Employees cannot “bank,” “borrow” or “carryover” summer flextime hours. In addition, lunch periods may not be skipped.  Employees must use the time during the week or it is lost. Summer hours will not be available during the week of July 4th.How to Participate If you are interested in participating in the Summer Hours Program, you will need to pre-plan with your co-workers and meet with your manager to discuss your schedule. Keep in mind that managers will need some time to collect requests to determine the best schedule that supports coverage. It is essential that we provide excellent service to our customers (internal & external) through the end of the normal work week. Your manager will determine the best possible work schedule to ensure that a sufficient number of people are in place to accomplish this.How to Record Your Time If you are in participating in the Summer Hours Program, you will need to record your actual hours worked on each day during that week.  You should not just enter in 8 hours for each work day.  For example, if you work one hour over on Monday through Thursday, you would enter 9 hours for each of those days and enter in 4 hours for Friday. Please note that this Summer Hours Program can be suspended or discontinued at the discretion of senior leaders based upon business or office needs.As we begin the summer, remember to be safe and to make work-life balance a priority! Enjoy this program over the coming months, and contact your Strategic Business Partner if you have any questions.Access more information on the processes and procedures for Summer Hours Program

Needs analysis is the process of determining all the critical job and employee related information for a specific business need.  This includes the necessary tasks, knowledge and skills required to perform the job as well as the capabilities required to perform the job effectively. The information gathered whilst conducting a job analysis can be used to create a job description.Job design is the process of defining the specific tasks and responsibilities at an individual or group level. The key components of job design include determining an employee’s responsibilities, authority over work, scope of decision making and Career Job Framework (CJF) code. Managers should also consider the hours and location of work and whether the job can be done flexibly.It is important that leaders take part in needs analysis and job design when reviewing positions in their team. This specifically applies to the recruitment process to ensure the right candidates are identified for positions based on merit and capability.Whilst some roles are unchanging and require automatic replacement, the opportunity to grow your team’s capability occurs with every new hire. Managers often replace a role at the same level of the previous incumbent, without considering what level is required for the role.

Coaching at Lendlease is about creating positive directed change. It is about developing potential and finding ways to live and work in a more productive, more satisfying way. The following information and resources are here to assist you in understanding and sourcing external coaching at Lendlease in Australia.  The use of an external qualified coach may not be suitable given the seniority of the person or development required. P&C plays a supportive and guiding role in the coaching relationship by providing strategic guidance on the right development approach and sourcing appropriate coaches to meet the development need.
Guiding Principles for Coaching at Lendlease
Business coaching is a partnering relationship between a professional coach and the employee that also requires the support of the manager and P&C SBP/Manager.
Business coaching is a finite relationship that involves the identification of goals and the development of strategies, relationships and action plans intended to achieve those goals. 
The success of coaching lies with firstly the individual and secondly with their manager who plays a critical role as they are active developers of their people. 
A clear development plan outlining the development need and course of action so that progress can be monitored.
Using an external coach does not replace the people practices of managing, training or performance management.

Coaching Request Form
If you’re interested in coaching, have a conversation with your manager who will assess this further with your P&C SBP/Manager.Once it is agreed that coaching is the right solution, the line manager and P&C SBP/Manager will complete the request form to initiate the process.
Resources
Tip Sheets: These tip sheets will provide you with information to help you gain a deeper understanding of what is involved in a formal business coaching process and help you prepare for the development activity.  For coaching to a be a success all parties involved need to know what is required of them and what role they play in the process.

Review date:
August 2017

Next review date:
August 2019

PURPOSE
All employees will be classified into one of the following categories:

Exempt
Non-Exempt

SCOPE
All Lendlease AMER Employees
POLICY
All employees will be classified into one of the following categories:
Exempt
Executives, professional employees, and certain administrative employees who meet certain requirements generally are exempt from earning overtime pay under applicable law. If an employee is classified as “exempt,” the employee will not be eligible for overtime pay. Exempt employees are paid a set salary that is not based on the number of hours worked per week. Exempt employees are expected to work as many hours as are reasonably required to perform their assigned work. Such extra hours are considered part of the nature of many exempt positions and are accounted for in total compensation.
Non-exempt
Professional and administrative employees who do not meet certain requirements are generally not exempt from earning overtime pay.  If an employee is classified as “non-exempt,” the employee is eligible for overtime payments and will be paid time and one-half for all hours worked over forty (40) in one workweek.  Certain states may also require overtime for hours worked in excess of eight (8) in one day.
The exemption classification depends entirely on the nature and responsibilities of the position and the relevant requirement of federal and local laws, regardless of the position level in the company. Any questions regarding position classification for a position within the Company should be directed to the Strategic Business Partner.

Lendlease recognizes the importance of parental leave to enable employees to fulfill their family responsibilities at the birth or adoption of a child. Parental or partner leave is available for both primary and non-primary care givers.Following significant life events (birth of your child, adoption or foster care placement up to age 18), eligible employees in the Americas and their families are supported through one of two parental and partner leave options:

Parental leave is available to a primary parent, which is someone who has primary or full-time responsibility for the care of the child immediately following the arrival of their child.  Upon arrival of the child you may take up to twelve weeks paid leave, and an additional unpaid leave period of up to eight weeks.

Partner leave is available to a spouse or domestic partner who does not have primary or full-time responsibility for the care of the child immediately following the arrival of their child.  Partner leave must be taken within the first eight weeks from the life event date in increments of no less than one business day.  Upon arrival of the child you may take up to two weeks (10 business days) of paid leave.

All leave taken under these policies will run concurrently with any FMLA leave, short-term disability leave, and any state or local leave to which you are entitled, where applicable and permissible under law.
The employee must provide the employer with at least 30 days’ notice when the need for this leave is foreseeable.  When an employee becomes aware less than 30 days in advance the employee must provide notice to their supervisor as soon as reasonable.

What are the eligibility requirements?
All full-time salaried employees are eligible for this benefit.

Regular one-on-ones are at the heart of our approach to performance management, encouraging frequent, open and constructive feedback on how employees are progressing throughout the year.

Our performance management approach aims to:

Lift our people's performance impact through regular feedback helping us to achieve greater organisational performance
Support our people's growth by providing development opportunities that advance their careers
Ensure outstanding performance and greater contribution is recognised and rewarded

In addition to regular one-on-ones are goal setting, mid-year and year-end conversations. These three conversations have specific objectives and guidelines, which you should review below.
Throughout the year we encourage ongoing conversations on career and wellbeing & flexibility. Initiated by employees, these conversations aim to help employees manage their careers and balance their wellbeing and flexibility needs.

GOAL SETTING
While you should regularly discuss your goals with your manager, the start of a new financial year and any time you commence a new role are the perfect times to set goals.  You should also review your goals during your mid-year conversation. Talk to your manager and agree your priorities, considering both 'what' is to be achieved and 'how' you are expected to achieve it.
Clear goals help to focus your efforts and ensure that you and your manager agree on what success looks like for the year ahead.  We recommend writing three to five goals using the SMART framework.
Goal Setting Guidelines     English   Chinese   Japanese   Italian
Goal Setting - Quick Fact Guide     English   Chinese   Japanese   Italian
MID-YEAR REVIEW CONVERSATION
Mid-year review conversations are an opportunity for employees and people managers to have a meaningful discussion on progress in the current year.  They allow us the opportunity to not only reflect on our performance & progress, but our wellbeing too.
It is also an ideal time to:

discuss what went well during the first half and what could be improved;
review the Financial Year goals and whether they need to be updated or amended;
check-in on health and wellbeing;
agree priorities for the rest of the year.

Each conversation will be different and may not touch upon all the suggested topics above.

YEAR-END REVIEW CONVERSATIONOur year-end review conversations are an opportunity for our employees and people leaders to discuss achievements, development and progress over the year, as well as any areas of focus to improve on for the future.
Year-end conversations take place in June-July of each year.  First, all employees complete a self-assessment in Workday on what went well during the year and what could have been improved.  Next, year-end conversations are arranged between managers and employees to allow a meaningful two-way feedback discussion.  People managers also need to complete the manager review in Workday and to provide a performance rating for each of their team members.

WELLBEING & FLEXIBILITY CONVERSATIONS
Lendlease is a place where you matter. We believe that if you are healthy and happy at work you are more likely to perform your best and be your best.
What can you do to improve your wellbeing and feel supported to work more flexibly? A wellbeing & flexibility conversation with your manager is a chance to talk about your current working arrangements, what you would like to change to better meet your flexibility needs, and anything else you might need to enhance your wellbeing at work.
You can find support materials under our conversation support page here, and information about wellbeing programs here.

PURPOSE Paid Time Off (PTO) provides you with the flexibility to use your accrued PTO to meet your personal needs, while recognizing your individual responsibility to manage to your accrued PTO balance.SCOPE All full time (scheduled to work 30 hours per week or more) salaried employees are eligible for PTO.POLICY
PTO can be used for vacations, illness, caring for others, medical/dental appointments, personal business or emergencies.
Your manager’s approval is needed for all PTO except in the event of sickness or an unplanned emergency. In these circumstances you are expected to notify your manager as soon as possible.To support a safe work environment for all employees, individuals who have a contagious illness should not report to work.PTO Bank Accrual PTO hours are earned or accrued each pay period based on the schedule below which assumes a 40 hour per week work schedule. Individuals scheduled to work less than 40 hours per week will have their accruals prorated based upon their weekly schedule.  PTO does not accrue while out on an unpaid leave of absence or while receiving Supplemental Military Pay.Effective October 3, 2015, the PTO accrual will be:

Length of Service

Annual PTO Accrual Rate

Bi-Weekly Accrual Rate

0 - 10 years

20 days

6.15 Hours

Tenth Anniversary +

25 days

7.69 Hours

Break in Service
When determining loss of service for PTO accruals for individuals who are rehired the following rules apply.For employees who have a break in service with the company of 12 months or less, prior years of service will be recognized, adjusting the hire date to reflect the break in service, if the following criteria are met:

prior years of service were as full-time, salaried employee, and
the employee has at least one year of uninterrupted prior service

Managing your PTO Balance
To request PTO or view your accrued balance, log in to Workday and click on the Absence Worklet. Employees must plan vacations, etc. around the accrued, or available, PTO balance and should avoid going into a negative balance. Employees may only go into a negative PTO balance with their manager’s prior approval. Further PTO requests will be managed closely to ensure a positive balance can be achieved in a reasonable amount of time. Additional requests for PTO while in a negative balance, may need to be unpaid.
The maximum number of hours that may be banked into your account is 300 hours. This is to encourage you to use your PTO and allows the company to manage its financial obligations.  Once you reach the 300-hour cap, you will not earn or accrue additional PTO hours until the PTO balance goes below the cap.  You will not receive retroactive credit for any accrual missed while above the cap limit.Should you leave the company, you will be paid any accrued, unused PTO balance, following termination. If your PTO balance is negative, then the negative balance will reduce your final paycheck, as allowed by applicable state laws.Please note when you leave the company, your last day of employment is your last day physically worked. PTO may not be used to extend your last day worked.Access more information on the processes and procedures for Paid Time Off

It is Lendlease policy to provide parents with up to 18 weeks' unpaid leave per child for the purposes of caring for that child, subject to meeting certain conditions.

What are the eligibility requirements?
Ordinary Parental Leave is available to all employees based in the UK who have completed at least one year's continuous service with the Company.
How do I apply?

PLAN

Read through the Ordinary Parental Leave Policy. 

PREPARE

In order to be able to apply for Ordinary Parental Leave during the period of your employment, you must first provide written evidence to your manager of your eligibility, outlining:
parental responsibility or expected responsibility for the child in question; and
the child's date of birth or date on which placement for adoption began.
If you are new to the Company, Lendlease reserves the right to request confirmation of Ordinary Parental Leave already taken from previous employers. That leave will then be deducted from any remaining entitlement once the qualifying period has been achieved.Enter your leave request in Workday at least 21 days before the date on which leave is proposed to start. Include the dates on which the period of leave is to begin and end.Requests to commence Ordinary Parental Leave immediately following the birth or adoption of a child must also be done so 21 days prior to the expected week of childbirth or adoption.If the period of the proposed leave is less than two weeks, the period of notice required is reduced to a period of twice the amount of the proposed leave.

ACT

Following leave approval, payroll will be informed to suspend pay during the period of Ordinary Parental Leave.

FINALISE

Once your return to work is confirmed, payroll will be informed to restart full pay.

Can my leave be postponed?
Lendlease may postpone a period of Ordinary Parental Leave (other than where Ordinary Parental Leave has been requested immediately after childbirth or immediately after placement for adoption and has met the written notice requirements) where the company considers that its business would be unduly disrupted if the employee were to take leave during the period requested.In such a case, the Company will allow the employee to take an equivalent period of Ordinary Parental Leave beginning no later than six months after the commencement of the period originally requested.Lendlease will give notice in writing of the postponement, stating the reason for it and specifying suggested dates for the employee to take Ordinary Parental Leave. Such notice will be given no more than seven days after the employee's notice was given to the Company.

At Lendlease we understand that our employees may occasionally require time off to work through issues relating to their dependents.  Each case will be viewed sympathetically. Normally employees will be paid for reasonable time off to resolve urgent issues and to put the necessary short or long term arrangements in place where:- A dependent falls ill, has been injured or is having a baby; - An injured or ill dependent requires long term care; - There is a disruption in care arrangements for a dependent; and / or - There is an unexpected incident involving a dependent’s schooling.

What are the eligibility requirements?
All full time or part time UK employees are eligible.  A dependent is the spouse, partner, child or parent of an employee. It also includes someone living in the same household who is a relative e.g. an elderly aunt, grandparent, etc. It does not include tenants or boarders.
How do I apply?

PLAN 

Time off for dependents may range from one or two hours to a day or more. In most cases one or two days should be sufficient to deal with the circumstance, and it must be a genuine emergency. 

ACT 

You should notify your manager as soon as possible of the reason for your absence and how long you expect to be absent. You should then enter the absence for dependents leave into Workday.

Employees are unable to supplement ATO time during days they are not at work. For example, if you take a PTO day on the same day the company has offered 2 hours of ATO for early office hours closing, you are not eligible for ATO. Similarly, while on a half day of PTO, you are unable to supplement any ATO time offered for office closings.Inclement Weather Time lost due to office closings or delays should be recorded as Authorized Time Off only if total hours for the week are under 40 hours.  If hours for the week meet or exceed 40, time lost due to the closing should not be recorded.  If an employee chooses to stay home and the office is not officially closed or delayed, personal, vacation time (or PTO) should be used.Bereavement If there is a death in your immediate family, please notify your manager as soon as possible.  Immediate family includes your spouse, domestic partner, child, parent (in-laws), sibling (in-laws) & grandparent (in-laws).  Authorized Time Off up to a maximum of five (5) paid days may be authorized.Military Training Services Refer to the Military Leave Page.Jury Duty If you are summoned to report for jury duty or as a subpoenaed witness in a civil or criminal proceeding, you will receive your regular pay for approved hours of absence for up to two weeks.  You may keep the jury duty check you receive.  If you are summoned for Grand Jury service, please advise your immediate manager.  An employee called for jury duty should give immediate notification to her/his supervisor in order to permit appropriate work planning.  If an employee is required to give jury service beyond a two-week period, special determination will be made regarding the extent of additional compensation.  If the employee is excused from jury duty on any day, it is expected that she/he will report for work.  You should obtain a court-supplied document of certification, completed by the court after your service is performed, as well as a copy of your pay voucher.Voting Time If an employee who is a registered voter does not have sufficient time to vote outside her/his working hours, she/he may receive paid time off to vote, not to exceed one hour at the beginning or end of the work day or in conjunction with the employee's lunch hour.  An employee who is not working for a least two (2) consecutive hours while the polls are open will be deemed to have sufficient time to vote.  An employee requesting time off to vote will schedule it with her/his supervisor before Election Day.Blood Donation Employees will be paid their straight time pay for time lost from their regularly scheduled working hours in order to donate blood to the Red Cross.  Such pay will include reasonable time spent going to and returning from the Blood Donor Centre.  Note that this policy applies to donation of blood to the Red Cross only.Community Service Employees are encouraged to become more involved in their communities by doing volunteer work.  Employees are entitled to do volunteer work during regular working hours not to exceed two hours per month unless unusual circumstances exist.  Approval of service by each employee's supervisor is necessary to ensure that the company's work is properly accomplished.

PURPOSE Respect for one another is an integral part of the Lendlease culture. This includes respecting individual ideas, views and beliefs. By providing employees with appropriate avenues for expressing their views, complaints and concerns, the Company is committed to maintaining good employee relations through effective communication and the resolution of work related issues.SCOPE

This policy applies in all geographies in which Lendlease operates.POLICY
Most issues or grievances can be resolved by open communication. An employee who wishes to express a complaint or concern regarding a work related problem is encouraged to resolve the issue informally through discussions with his or her immediate manager. Alternatively, the employee may wish to discuss their concerns, thoughts or comments with another manager in the organisation or their local Strategic Business Partner - People & Culture.Employees are free to raise any issue using any of these avenues of communication without fear of coercion, discrimination, or reprisal. There will be no retaliation against any employee for raising concerns. All issues, concerns, investigations and resolutions will be kept confidential (where practicable and appropriate under the circumstances).Group companies in each jurisdiction may also have their own more detailed procedures which supplement this Policy and take into account local protected disclosure and other laws. Where there is any inconsistency between local laws and procedures and this Policy, those local laws and procedures will prevail.

Americas Legal & Compliance

Approver's name and title:
Michael G. SerafinoChief Compliance & Litigation Officer, Americas

Effective date:
September 2020

Review date:
September 2020

Next review date:
January 2022

PURPOSE
Perceived benefits of engaging an individual as an independent contractor (also referred to as a “consultant”) include the avoidance of certain benefits afforded to employees under federal, state, and local law. For example, independent contractors are not entitled to minimum wage or overtime pay under federal or state law, and a company also avoids tax withholding and remittance and insurance obligations. However, it is important to understand that where an individual is incorrectly classified as an independent contractor rather than an employee, the company could be in violation of applicable law. Independent contractor engagements must not be for purposes of avoiding the provision of benefits or the payment of applicable taxes.
Misclassifying individuals as consultants or independent contractors may result in significant penalties to Lendlease. Penalties could include significant tax, wage, and benefit liabilities; unanticipated (and perhaps underinsured) tort liability to third parties for injuries caused by contractors; as well as significant fines and/or license revocation. In addition, having an individual work without a contractual or employment relationship exposes Lendlease to undue risk.
Please follow this Policy prior to making any commitment to engage an independent contractor to provide services to Lendlease in the Americas, including engaging a former employee to provide services to the Business. Failing to follow policy and procedure could result in penalties to you, up to and including termination.
SCOPE
This policy applies to all employees in the Americas Region of Lendlease including those who are permanent or fixed term and working full-time or part-time.
POLICY
The engagement of an independent contractor or consultant must be approved by Americas People & Culture, Tax, and Legal before Lendlease makes any commitment or services begin. These procedures apply to contracts for the provision of business services (as distinct from vendors providing goods and materials under a purchase order or supply agreement).
It is the relevant Business' obligation to submit requests for initial approval or renewal to People & Culture with sufficient time for People & Culture, Tax, and Legal to conduct review. It is the relevant Business' obligation to work with People & Culture to properly classify the individual. Legal will confirm once all required approvals have been obtained before People & Culture proceeds with onboarding the individual in the appropriate classification.
Start by engaging your People & Culture Strategic Business Partner. People & Culture will consider the facts relevant to the engagement, including interviewing the hiring manager and/or the individual as appropriate, using the Independent Contractor Classification Tool (defined below).  People & Culture will thoroughly document the relevant facts.
Where further review is necessary, People & Culture will provide the relevant facts to regional compliance counsel, who will, as appropriate, review the proposed classification and consult with People & Culture.
In the event the principal or employees of a corporation will provide the services, as opposed to an individual or sole proprietor of a LLC, further review may not be necessary to approve independent contractor status.  In the event an individual will be acting as an employee rather than a consultant, and classification as an independent contractor is not appropriate, People & Culture will advise regarding onboarding the individual under the appropriate classification.
All independent contractor engagements require a current, written agreement setting forth the terms of the relationship, which must be reviewed and approved by Legal.
CONSEQUENCES OF BREACHING THIS POLICY
Disciplinary action may be taken at Lendlease’s sole discretion if this policy is breached. This may include action up to and including dismissal in appropriate circumstances.
Penalties against Lendlease for misclassifying individuals as independent contractors could include significant tax, wage, and benefit liabilities; unanticipated (and perhaps underinsured) tort liability to third parties for injuries caused by contractors; significant fines and license revocation; as well as debarment from public contracting.

Group or Regional Legal and Company Secretarial
Purpose
This Group Code of Conduct Breach Reporting Procedure provides a mechanism for raising concerns about unethical or illegal business conduct, including behaviour which may not accord with our Core Values or Code of Conduct, and offers certain protections to anyone who reports concerns in good faith under this Group Procedure.
Instructions
Procedures for making a disclosure under this Group Policy
1. Business Conduct Officers
Lendlease has established Business Conduct Officers to serve as the primary points of contact for the disclosure of unethical or illegal conduct.  Group officers, employees and contractors may raise concerns by contacting the Business Conduct Officer in their region or, if preferred, the Group Business Conduct Officer.
2. Employee Conduct Hotline
The Lendlease Employee Conduct Hotline is a secure and independent channel for you to raise genuine concerns, seek further assistance and report potential employee conduct breaches that you have felt uncomfortable in raising or resolving through the other channels available to you. It is hosted by EthicsPoint, an external organisation that helps companies foster a culture of integrity and compliance.
The Lendlease Employee Conduct Hotline offers:

Confidential reporting and the choice to remain anonymous
Telephone and web-based reporting options in over 180 languages
24-hour access, seven days a week
Ability to follow up on your concern, even if you choose to remain anonymous

It is important to note that the information you submit will be treated confidentially. Following each call or web contact, the hotline operator will forward a report to the appropriate Business Conduct Officer within Lendlease for review and handling. Your report is given a report key so that you can check back to receive a response or provide more information.
Disclosures may be anonymous
The individual making the disclosure may choose whether or not to make the disclosure anonymously.  It may not be possible to investigate the disclosure as thoroughly if it is made anonymously than where the individual gives their details.  In addition, in some countries the individual may need to reveal their identity before making the disclosure to qualify for protection under protected disclosure laws.  Further information on local laws can be obtained from the Business Conduct Officer in the relevant region.
Flowchart of procedures for making a disclosure under this Group Policy

Investigation of disclosures
The action taken to investigate disclosures under this procedure will necessarily depend on the particular circumstances.  Where the individual has provided their contact details, they will be informed in general terms of the status of the disclosure and the final outcome of any investigation, unless privacy, confidentiality or other legal constraints limit the feedback that can be provided.
Generally, disclosures made under the Policy will be treated confidentially, and in some countries the law requires that a disclosure remains confidential unless the individual making the disclosure gives their consent to the disclosure being revealed.  For this reason, you may be asked for such consent if you make a disclosure in order to facilitate the investigation process and to enable Lendlease to reach a satisfactory outcome.  For example, to investigate the disclosure it may be necessary to reveal its substance to people such as other Lendlease personnel, external consultants involved in the investigation process and, in appropriate circumstances, law enforcement agencies.  At some point in time, it may also be necessary to disclose the fact and substance of the disclosure to the person who is the subject of the disclosure.
If an individual’s identity is disclosed during the investigation process, the individual will not be disadvantaged in their employment by any Group company.
Reprisal action will not be tolerated
Lendlease will not tolerate the taking of detrimental action against individuals who make a disclosure under this procedure in reprisal for making the disclosure.  Any officer or employee who takes or threatens to take detrimental action in reprisal will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include dismissal.
Further, under some countries’ laws, the taking of detrimental action in reprisal for making a disclosure may be an offence and/or may give the individual who has made the disclosure the right to seek compensation.  Further information on the laws that apply in a particular country is available from the relevant Business Conduct Officer.
If an individual believes that they have been, or are likely to be, disadvantaged in any way by another officer or employee or a Group company because they have made a disclosure, they should contact their manager or the Business Conduct Officer in their region.
Fairness to persons against whom disclosures are made
Lendlease recognises that individuals against whom disclosures are made are entitled to be treated fairly.  Disciplinary action may be taken against employees found to have made disclosures containing malicious or unfounded allegations.
Anyone who makes a disclosure under this Group Policy, but is later found to have been actively involved in the wrongdoing, will be subject to the same investigation process, including any disciplinary or criminal proceedings.

A secondment is when a business unit or project has a temporary need for resource support which can be met by moving an employee from their current role for a defined period of time. It is anticipated at the end of the secondment employees will return to the role they left. A secondment can be a valuable way for our people to gain experience and develop skills and knowledge across our business.Secondments may emerge from a number of situations:- You may be asked to join a team or project because of your specific skills or experience.- A manager or project leader may consult with People & Culture and/or their peers about a particular short-term resourcing need.- You may discuss your interest in a secondment with your manager as a way of further developing your skills and experience.  Your manager may be able to assist in finding secondment opportunities to facilitate this development request.

What are the eligibility requirements?
There are no specific eligibility requirements to apply for or to take up a secondment opportunity. Before applying for any opportunity you should discuss your application with your manager. You should be clear about what your objectives are when submitting your application and also what business rationale your application supports.
What are the different types of secondments?
An internal secondment is where an employee moves temporarily to a different Lendlease business unit or project. Employees remain in their home country but may move office locations. If an employee is required to move locations within country, it may be considered as a ‘temporary relocation’.  The type and level of support available varies depending on location. For more information about support when temporarily moving locations please refer to your region’s policy in the resources section below.An external secondment is where an employee moves temporarily to an external organisation to work on a project or assignment. The employee remains employed by Lendlease and remains in their home country. For more information on external secondments please contact your local People & Culture representative.An international assignment is where an employee moves temporarily to a role or project in another country. The employee remains employed by Lendlease in their home country. For more information on international assignments please review the Global Mobility Framework and related policies.
How do I move forward?

PLAN 

Think about your personal objectives and business rationale for your move.Discuss secondment opportunities with your manager in your regular one-on-one meetings.Review opportunities on Workday.Australian employees should read  the Secondment (Local Assignment) Policy.  

PREPARE 

Discuss with your current manager and plan what would happen with your current responsibilities during your secondment.Set out some specific objectives for the secondment with your current manager. 

ACT 

If you are interested in pursuing a specific secondment opportunity speak to your manager or People & Culture representative.Prepare for an appropriate handover of your current responsibilities. 

FINALISE 

Generally your terms and conditions of employment will remain unchanged during the secondment, but you will receive a letter outlining the nature and expected duration of the secondment, including details of your reporting relationships.During your secondment, you will report to a manager in the host business unit, and this business is responsible for paying your salary and other costs.At the completion of the secondment you will typically return to your original role and business unit. Occasionally, secondments can become permanent and this typically occurs if the hosting manager requests this change, and all parties agree.  In this case the terms and conditions of your employment will adjust to the new permanent role.

Professional development starts with understanding the key capabilities essential to your role. These frameworks provide a roadmap for career growth by identifying specific skills and competencies. Collaborate with your manager to talk through the capabilities you want to develop, then create a targeted development plan.  As you progress, look for the experiences, exposure to new situations and formal education that will continue to improve your capabilities over time.
There are three sets of capabilities that help us be successful in our roles:

Lendlease capabilities – these eight capabilities apply to all roles at all levels at Lendlease.  No matter what you do, or where you work in Lendlease these are the capabilities that are critical to our success.  You should be proficient in all these capabilities at a level appropriate to your role.
Job family/category capabilities – these capabilities apply to certain job families in Lendlease and are designed to give you comprehensive, in-depth knowledge of the behaviours required for success, in particular roles, throughout our business.  Select the Job Family Framework appropriate for your role to learn more.
Mission critical capabilities - these 12 capabilities are specifically for Development, Construction, Investment Management and Digital. As this is an evolving and living document - these capabilities will change with time as we continue to grow within our strategy.

How do I use the Lendlease Capabilities Framework?
Firstly, spend time understanding the Lendlease Capabilities and other relevant frameworks, and consider what proficiency level you are today.  Have a conversation with your manager about their expectation of proficiency level in your role. 
Once you understand the expectations in your role use the frameworks to map your development plan and participate in development opportunities.  You should aim to develop your capabilities using a mixture of experience, exposure and education. Use these resources to learn more:
Development Planning Through Experience, Exposure and Education
Build your capability with Workday Learning

How can I teach my team more about Lendlease Capabilities?
As a leader it is important that you spend time talking to your team about the capabilities required to do your jobs well.
You can use the provided resources below to conduct a short meeting with your team on the capabilities. Spend some time as a team considering how you can apply the capabilities. Consider which are your team’s strengths and which capabilities you may want to develop as a team. Then decide, as a team, which capabilities you will focus on improving in the future and consider adding these to individual development plans.

Effective date:

Review date:

Next review date:

PURPOSE Creating a better future for people is at the heart of our vision 'to create the best places'. That includes actively caring for our employees' physical and mental health, as well as their safety. To create a healthier culture, Lendlease recognizes the importance of leadership in ensuring that our people perform at their best, and are supported to feel healthy and well. This is why Lendlease offers Wellbeing Days to eligible employees, as one of the ways to encourage and inspire individual physical and mental wellbeing. This benefit is provided in addition to your Paid Time Off (PTO) program.This policy outlines the conditions and guidelines for the Wellbeing Days.SCOPE All active, salaried employees scheduled to work 30 or more hours per week are eligible. This policy does not apply to hourly employees.Newly hired employees with start dates within a 4-month period (as referred to in the 'Benefits' section below) will be eligible for the Wellbeing Day at the start of the next period.POLICY All eligible employees are entitled to one (1) paid Wellbeing Day every four (4) calendar months, subject to the conditions in this policy.Employees are encouraged to use these days at regular intervals throughout the year for preventative physical and mental health services and positively impacting wellbeing activities. As such, Wellbeing Days do not carry over each period, may not be used in advance of the next period, nor are they paid out upon termination of employment. Application Process Employees must apply for Wellbeing Days in advance. Employees are not required to disclose the reason for the leave application; however, manager approval is required for the timing of the leave. It is expected that leave days will be taken at a time when business is not unduly impacted, and if necessary, alternative timing can be agreed between the employee and their manager.Lendlease fundamentally believes in the importance of having regular, short breaks for maintaining our health and wellbeing. As such, Lendlease actively encourages employees to take Wellbeing Days at consistent intervals throughout the year.Wellbeing Days can only be taken as a full or half day, per leave application. A maximum of one (1) day Wellbeing Day can be taken in each specified 4-month period, as follows:

January 1 through April 30
May 1 through August 31

Our people and their development are fundamental to our ability to succeed as an organisation. So, it is important that we understand our people's aspirations and potential as well as the types of roles we need in order to help them and the organisation plan for the future. Our talent review process combined with succession planning is one of the ways we do that.

FY25 Talent Review training sessions for People Managers
If you’re a People Manager completing the FY25 talent review for your team, you can watch the recording of the training session about the process and what you need to do.

Talent Review
Talent review at Lendlease enables us as a business to provide greater career progression and development opportunities for our people. In a talent review, we ask people managers to assess each of their team members in three ways – potential, performance over time, and aspiration.
Potential, performance over time, and an individual’s career aspirations provides Lendlease increased transparency of our talent – ensuring we have the right people ready for business-critical roles – while also providing greater career progression and development opportunities for our people.
Measuring potential is based on the five dimensions of Learning Agility: mental agility, people agility, change agility, results agility, and self-awareness. You can read more about each learning agility in How to Complete Talent Assessment guide for People Managers (in the resources section below). 
This year we’re also asking People Managers to indicate a Target Next Role for each of their team members during talent review, along with a judgment about their Readiness for that target role. This information will help leadership teams to consider a broader pool of potential successors for critical roles that is also aligned to our peoples’ aspirations.  
Talent review is conducted on a global basis annually, between September and December. Talent conversations amongst leadership teams take place both during the talent review period and throughout the year – generally on a quarterly or as needs basis.  

Succession Planning
People managers regularly review and develop succession plans for roles within their team, identifying people who have both the potential and the aspiration to do a certain role. This is often conducted in conjunction with talent review but is an activity that can take place at any time during the year.
The data collected through talent reviews, performance reviews, career conversations or an employee’s Workday career profile, is used to:

identify potential successors,
determine their level of readiness,
and to create tailored development plans.

Our aim is to have a broad and diverse pool of people who are ready to step into key positions within the organisation.

Our people are at the heart of everything we do, so your health and wellbeing is important to us. Keeping you safe and well, both physically and mentally is the aim of Wellbeing leave. This enables eligible employees with the opportunity to proactively focus on their mental and physical wellbeing so they are able to return to work feeling refreshed, more positive, engaged and able to perform at their best. A suite of mental health programs are also now offered to employees and their families, covering mind health, active intervention and recovery support. The guidelines below will be reviewed occasionally, to ensure their ongoing relevance. Lendlease reserves the right to change or cancel this leave benefit at any time.

What are the eligibility requirements?
Wellbeing leave is available to all employees who have successfully completed their probationary period. It is a discretionary benefit that does not form part of an employee’s contract of employment. This benefit does not apply to agency workers or self-employed contractors.
The expectation is that each eligible employee will take one day in every fourth month period to focus on their wellbeing 
How do I apply?

PLAN 

Wellbeing leave is intended to be used for activities where there is a perceived health benefit, to proactively prevent illness and positively impact wellbeing. Employees are entrusted to use their judgement to utilise these days as they deem appropriate for their own health and wellbeing.Employees can take Wellbeing leave as a half or full day on separate dates. Booking on consecutive days is not permitted. We trust you to use Wellbeing leave reasonably and appropriately and encourage the leave to be taken at consistent intervals throughout the year.It is expected that Wellbeing leave days will only be requested at a time when the business is not unduly impacted, and if necessary, alternative timing may be agreed between you and your manager.You must apply for Wellbeing leave in advance. Think about what time and the type of activity you would like to undertake. Examples of programs include: 

Addiction Help Program 

Wellbeing education / Health coaching 

Counselling 

One day Yoga / meditation course 

Wellness Check 

Carers Respite 

Please note: the examples above are for guidance purposes only and is not intended to be an exhaustive list.Wellbeing leave cannot be:- Used to extend an annual leave period;- Carried over from year to year; - Paid out when you leave Lendlease; - On consecutive days.

ACT 

You must apply for Wellbeing leave in advance via Workday.Wellbeing leave can be taken as a half day or more. You are not required to disclose the reason for the leave application.
Your Wellbeing leave will be automatically approved in Workday.

FINALISE 

If necessary, create or revise your department calendars to reflect your time away from the office and/or out of office automatic replies within MSOffice Outlook.

How does it differ from other leave offerings?
Wellbeing leave is treated as the preventative portion of sick leave allowing employees to take a pre-booked half or full day off work to engage in an activity that benefits their health and wellbeing. Wellbeing leave is not a form of flexible working. Flexible working is an alternative working practice, rather than a form of leave.Sick leave is for recovery and is intended to ensure employees take the appropriate time to recover and rehabilitate from an illness or injury.Annual leave is paid time off work granted to employees to be used for whatever the employee wishes.
How is the offering monitored and reported?
The usage of the Wellbeing leave benefit will be monitored to see how successful the uptake is and to understand the impact on employees and also on sick leave, if any. We would like to learn more about how Wellbeing leave is used and may periodically survey applicants for anonymous feedback. However, we do acknowledge that employees might choose not to participate for the purposes of confidentiality.The allocation of Wellbeing leave is discretionary but will be monitored alongside the sick leave allocation. 
Who can I contact regarding the benefit?

Flexibility is important to Lendlease. It enables us to retain our people, which means continuity for our business and our clients.For Lendlease, flexibility is about when and where people work. It is an essential part of creating an effective organization. There is significant evidence that flexibility helps people work smarter and optimize resources and productivity in a highly competitive business environment.Flexible work arrangements are not an entitlement, so employees should not assume that if they ask for flexibility they will automatically get it. These work arrangements need to be mutually beneficial to the business and the employee. After due consideration, managers may turn down requests for a flexible work arrangement if business needs cannot be met.

What are the eligibility requirements?
All Lendlease active, salaried employees scheduled to work 30 or more hours per week are eligible to apply for flexible work arrangements. 
How do I submit a request for flexible working?

PLAN 

Review the eligibity criteriaRead through the documents available under the Resources section of this page 

PREPARE 

Work through Step 1 of the Implementation Approach document and make an initial consideration of the type of flexible work arrangement you intend to propose to your manager. Fill out the Flexible Work Arrangement Conversation Guide and submit it to your manager. 

ACT 

Discuss your interests and proposal for a flexible work arrangement with your manager; this stage of the process may take some time while you and your manager discuss and agree on the proposed flexible work arrangement. At the end of the discussions, if you and your manager have agreed and are satisfied with the terms, your manager may approve the flexible work arrangement. 

FINALISE

Once the flexible work arrangement has been agreed, sign and retain a copy of the Flexible Work Arrangement Conversation Guide. This will serve as a helpful reference to key aspects of the agreed arrangement. 

What are some examples of flexible work?
There are a range of creative and practical ways to change when and where work is done. Some of the more traditional forms of flexible work arrangements include:When people work • Flexible start/finish times. Flexible start finish times allow for employees and managers to negotiate start and finish times that work for all parties.• Reconfiguring workweek.• Part-time work. Generally speaking, working fewer than the standard weekly hours. Note: Benefits eligibility will be impacted if scheduled less than 30 hours weekly.When people work • Working remotely. Also called teleworking, this means working away from the main office or site (i.e. at home) either full or part-time, and on a regular or intermittent basis.• May be appropriate only during specific phases of a project.• Ensure you check the project contract for potential issues.Applicable examples include:Project site: • Ida Crown Jewish Academy in Skokie, IL - Team coordinated flexible start and finish times to accommodate rush hour and travel distances, while still allowing full coverage on site  - Superintendent starts at 6:00am and is generally the first person to leave the site  - Senior Project Manager starts between 6:30am/7:00am and is generally the next person to leave the site after the Superintendent  - Project Manager starts at 7:00am and is generally the last person to leave the site• Lumina in San Francisco, CA  - Mix of Project Managers, Control Staff and Field Superintendents take every fourth Friday afternoon offOffice-based: • Office-based people manager in PM&C works from home on regular basis, with schedule driven by calendar • Development Manager leaves at 2:30pm on Mondays and makes up the time by working in the evenings • Administrative Assistant starts at 6:30am and finishes at 3:30pm

PURPOSE The company recognizes national holidays.SCOPE All Lendlease salaried employees in US.POLICY For purposes of paid holidays, the Company recognizes the following days as paid time off:

New Year's Day
Martin Luther King Day
President's Day 
Memorial Day 
Independence Day 
Labor Day
Veteran's Day
Thanksgiving Day and the day after Thanksgiving (two days) 
Christmas Day

Any of the above holidays that fall on Saturday will be observed on Friday. Holidays falling on a Sunday will be observed on Monday. If Christmas falls on a Tuesday or a Thursday, you'll receive an additional paid day off - the Monday before or the Friday after the holiday.Holidays that fall during an employee's vacation period will not be counted against vacation time.Whenever an employee is required to work on an observed holiday, equivalent time off will be provided on a day approved by the company.Supervisors are responsible for coordinating and approving holidays among their personnel and with other related departments.In order to receive holiday pay, an employee must either work or use a PTO day on the last business day before and on the first business day after a holiday. If an employee is on an FMLA leave and is using his or her accrued PTO on the last business day before and on the first business day after the holiday during the FMLA leave period in which the holiday falls, the employee will receive holiday pay for the holiday. If an employee is on an unpaid FMLA leave during the period on which the holiday falls, then the employee will not be paid for the holiday that occurs during the leave.
An employee will receive payment of short-term disability ("STD") benefits during his or her leave period, including on the holiday that occurs during the leave period, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Company's short-term disability program.Holidays — Less than 40-Hour Work Week or Non-traditional Work Weeks  An employee's reduced work schedule may or may not require the employee to work every week day. Therefore, an employee is paid for a holiday based on the number of hours the employee was scheduled to work on the day the holiday occurs. For example:Employee A — is scheduled to work Monday through Thursday for eight hours each day. When a holiday falls on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, this employee is eligible for eight hours of holiday pay. When a holiday falls on Friday, this employee receives no paid time off for that holiday.Employee B — is scheduled to work six hours a day, Monday through Friday. This employee would be eligible for six hours of holiday pay for any holiday.Employee C — is scheduled to work four hours a day, Monday through Friday. This employee would not be eligible for any holiday pay because an employee must be scheduled to work at least 30 hours a week to be eligible for holiday pay.* Paid Time Off taken in observance of a company holiday (as outlined in the Holiday Policy) should be recorded on the employees bi-weekly timesheet on the appropriate line marked as “Holiday”.

As part of our focus on employee health and wellbeing, Lendlease has secured medical insurance at corporate rates for our employees. The following plans are available through United Healthcare for Mainland employees. United Healthcare Savings Account Plan (HSA) 
The United Healthcare Choice Plus Health Savings Account (HSA) Option combines a consumer driven health plan (“CDHP”) with a health savings account (“HSA”). If you enrol in this option, you may open an HSA and make contributions to your HSA that may be used to pay for qualified out-of-pocket medical expenses. The Company will also make a Company Contribution to your HSA on your behalf, provided you open an HSA bank account. The Lendlease funded amounts are $520 for individuals; $1040 for families. Your HSA belongs to you and you may use the account to save for your eligible health expenses (refer to IRS Publication 969), including health expenses that may arise after you retire.  If you do not use the amounts in your HSA, the account balance may continue to grow with your contributions (and earnings or losses from investments). The Deductibles for the United Healthcare Choice Plus HSA Option are higher than the Deductibles for the United Healthcare Choice Plus Option, but your HSA may be used for those out-of- pocket expenses needed to meet the Deductibles.

United Healthcare Choice Plus Plan 
The United Healthcare Choice Plus Option offers health coverage for more premium contributions than the United Healthcare Choice Plus HSA Option, but the Deductibles for in-network and out-of-network providers are lower.
Review your medical plan options including premiums, deductibles, and co-payments to make your choice on healthcare options. The HSA typically has lower premiums, but a higher deductible. Preventive care is not subject to a deductible.
Click here to review the United Healthcare (UHC) Medical Plan Comparison document for more detailed information.
United Healthcare Out-Of-Area Preferred Provider Organisation (PPO) Plan 
The United Healthcare PPO Option is available for employees living outside the United Healthcare network. 
The San Francisco Choice Option is available for certain employees working on contracts involving the City or County of San Francisco who are covered by the San Francisco Health Care Accountability Ordinance (“Eligible HCOA Employees”).  The San Francisco Choice Option provides Eligible HCOA Employees with the opportunity to obtain employee-only medical coverage at no premium cost.  However, employees who wish to cover their spouse or dependents will be responsible for 100% of the cost of the spouse or dependents’ premium.  This Option is available only to Eligible HCOA Employees.
Express Scripts Prescription Drug Plan 
Express Scripts is the administrator of our prescription drug benefit. The benefit provides comprehensive prescription drug coverage for name brand and generic medications through participating pharmacies, including mail order discounts for maintenance medications. The Prescription Drug Benefit Program is only available if you elect the Medical Benefit Program.
Eligibility 
Full -time salaried or hourly employee (non-union) regularly scheduled to work at least 30 hours per week. Salaried employees are eligible to participate in the Benefit Programs on their date of hire. Hourly employees are eligible to participate in the Benefits Programs the first day of the month following or coincident with completion of two months of continuous employment (at least 260 hours) from their most recent hire date (but no later than the 91st day after their most recent hire date).
How do I enrol
As a new hire, you have 31 days from your start date to elect healthcare benefits. New employees should go to the Benefits Center (www.Lendlease.hrintouch.com) to complete all benefit enrolments with the exception of the 401(K) plan. Per the Plan provisions, if you do not make an affirmative election to enrol in, or decline healthcare coverage (i.e., fail to enrol) within 31 days from your start date, you will be deemed to have elected to waive coverage under all Plans, except the Plan’s default benefits.
When enrolling an eligible dependent, such as a spouse/domestic partner or child(ren), certain documentation will be required for verification, such as a birth certificate, marriage certificate.
If you miss the 31-day election window, you will be able to enrol during the Open Enrolment period in November for benefits to be effective January 1 of the following year.
If you have a qualifying event, such as a marriage, divorce, birth of a child, loss of other coverage, etc. you will be able to change your benefit elections mid-year by going to the Benefits Center within 31 days following the life event.

Lendlease employees have the opportunity to salary sacrifice for a range of benefits. By choosing to salary sacrifice, an employee forgoes a portion of their total remuneration (TPV minus superannuation guarantee contributions) in lieu of a benefit item offered, to an equivalent value from their pre-tax pay. This in turn will reduce an employee’s taxable salary and therefore may have the effect of lowering an employee’s marginal rate of tax on their salary. Some of the benefit items available to salary sacrifice include:• Superannuation • Employee Share Acquisition Plan • Purchased Leave • Motor Vehicles • Parking • Other variable packaged items (see below)Click on the benefits above to find out further information on how to salary package these items. To salary sacrifice Superannuation, ESAP or purchase additional leave, please use the benefits worklet in Workday and select Salary Sacrifice. Wages employees please complete the below salary sacrifice form and send through to payroll.In addition to the benefits above, there are a number of variable packaged items covered through the salary packaging options at Lendlease.

What variable packaged items are available to salary package?
Taxi / Rideshare Travel (to and from work) Taxi / rideshare travel to and from the office on days you are working (including weekends when you work) is exempt from fringe benefits tax (FBT).To be eligible for the exemption and for reimbursement via salary sacrifice, the journey must be a single trip, and either begin or end at your place of work. It is not necessary that the trip begin or end at your home; nor is it necessary that the trip occur immediately before or after work.Airline lounge membership View the personal Qantas Club membership page in the resources section below to find out more information on memberships at discounted corporate rates. iPads/tablet You can salary package a tablet or iPad if it is to be used primarily for business purposes (more than 51%), and only if Lendlease does not already supply you with one.  Please note that no accessories can be included.Briefcases   A briefcase to be used primarily for business purposes can be salary packaged. A briefcase is a flat, rectangular case of leather or other material used for carrying documents, books, manuscripts and does not include modern bags such as satchel bags, wheeled business cases, backpacks, shoulder bags, laptop bags, etc.
How do I salary package a variable packaged item?

PREPARE 

Confirm the item is eligible for salary packaging by referring to the policy or, if required, asking People Connect.

ACT 

For Superannuation, ESAP or Purchased leave submit via the benefits worklet in Workday.
You can change your salary sacrifice contributions to your superannuation in Workday at anytime, but your numbers should always be submitted as a full annual amount.  Simply go to the benefits worklet from the home screen, click on benefits under change, select salary sacrifice and choose the first day of the current month as the Benefits Event Date and then submit.  Click on open and you will be taken to the screen that summarises your elected benefits. Select the type of salary sacrifice by clicking elect and simply change the annual amount and click continue to complete.
Keep in mind the number should always be an annual amount. For example, if you would like to salary sacrifice $20,000 over the next three months you need to multiply the monthly contribution you would like to make by 12, as the Workday system only accepts an annual amount - so would would enter $80,000, because: (20,000/3)*12 = 80,000.
Please remember that the deductions roll over from one month to another so if you would like to reduce your salary sacrifice at the end of a period you will need to go back into Workday and adjust the amount. If you would like to cease salary sacrificing contributions to your superannuation you will need to select 'waive' in Workday, this will update the annual amount field to zero.
For all other items purchase the item using your own funds and retain the receipt.
Complete a Salary Packaging Work-Related Items Declaration Form and upload to Concur with your expense claim. Ensure that you attach a copy of the tax invoice/s.

Use the codes listed in the claimable items section to show that the purchase is to be debited to your salary package. The full amount claimed will be credited to your bank account but your salary package will only be charged the amount minus any input credit.  

FINALISE 

Please note you are limited to one claim within each variable packaging item category (taxis travel excluded) in each Fringe Benefit Taxation year (1 April to 31 March)

Leadership
Few leaders are born.  Most grow through skill building, experience, self reflection and a whole lot of work. 
  What is the quality that sets leaders apart? We believe it is in how we earn and demonstrate trust, how we care about people and our environment, how we strive for excellence and how we work as a team. A great leader can act with confidence and with humility based on what the situation calls for.  Some days they have to demonstrate both.  A great leader will provide strong direction when needed, and at other times give freedom to test, adapt and learn. At Lendlease, we are all leaders.  We are place makers and value creators. And we are committed to developing and retaining the best people. 
 Leadership Playbook

Expectations of Leaders

Lendlease continues to build more projects in places around the world. While we are building better futures for others, we are also building better futures for ourselves by offering great career opportunities. The Global Mobility Framework (GMF) governs the way Lendlease supports its employees when they move across borders for extended periods of work. This can include relocations to anywhere Lendlease operates, a neighbouring country, or to the other side of the world.
The GMF and associated policies have been developed for use across the Group.  They provide direction and guidance for managers, employees and People & Culture professionals to structure international assignments and transfers appropriately.  Any exceptions to the policies require sign off by authorised representatives in regional and/or global roles. 
The GMF ensures mobility for our employees at Lendlease is: 

Fair, equitable, transparent and competitive in the marketplace; 
Provides resourcing solutions whilst enabling talent development in growth markets; 
Perceived as a positive career differentiator and not a career risk; 
Governed by policies and processes which are cost effective, benchmarked and implemented consistently; and, 
Not an opportunity to achieve personal financial advantage.

The Global Mobility Business Decision Tree uses a series of questions to assess which policy is most appropriate to the circumstances. It should be used by employees, line managers and Strategic Business Partners.  For full details of the assignment provisions please refer to the individual policy documents.Underpinning the framework are four policies which define the support provided to employees in different circumstances.

Managing Performance

“If you’re trying to achieve, there will be roadblocks.  I’ve had them; everybody has had them. But obstacles don't have to stop you. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it.”  Michael Jordan, Basketball player, cultural icon.

Key to a People Manager’s role is creating an engaged work culture and exhibiting behaviours that are in line with Lendlease’s core values and key principles.
 The Leadership calendar of people processes can help you identify what your team needs throughout the year.  To manage performance in the best possible way, these people processes need to be supplemented with continuous conversations, and open and transparent communication.
Leaders have to Lead

Have regular one on one’s with everyone in your team. Be consistent and make these a priority.
Set goals and be clear on objectives and expectations. Walk the talk and set the example for your team.
Give feedback. See something great? Acknowledge it and be specific about why it was valuable. See something you don’t like? Have a conversation about it quickly.
Know your team. Understand what makes them feel value, engaged and supported. Diversity of thought, backgrounds and experience all bring rich value to a team’s success so ensure everyone has a chance to contribute and be heard.
Communicate key messages. Ensure you share important organisational messages with your team so that they know what it means for them and the work they are undertaking.
Measure outcomes and behaviours. With teams working all over the globe, you may be responsible for individuals who you can’t see day to day. Set clear expectations on what they need to deliver and by when. Measure their output and their engagement. Assume the best of your people.

Managing Poor Performance
Underperformance or poor performance can include not performing duties, or not performing them to the required standard; displaying negative or disruptive behaviour in the workplace and or failing to comply with workplace policies, rules or procedures. Underperformance doesn’t just affect the output of an individual employee – it can also impact co-workers, customers and business productivity.
There are many reasons why an employee might perform poorly. An employee might not know what’s expected of them because goals and standards are unclear or they may not have the knowledge or skills to do the job.

Managing Poor Performance (digital)
The Art of Feedback (digital)
Managing Poor Performance Toolkit
Performance Improvement Plan Template

Managing High Performance
When you acknowledge high performance, it not only builds team morale, but also validates the individual’s or team’s effort to achieve their goals.
High performers represent an enormous asset to your team, but leading them can require you to think a little differently.  Consider how you will continue to develop, engage, support and retain these individuals. Continuous conversations with high performers are essential. 

Set Stretch Targets and keep them challenged.
Sponsor them for projects that will build their development while leveraging their skills and capabilities.
Give them autonomy to get the job done.  Tell them what to do, but not how to do it. Situational Leadership can help with this.
Make sure they are rewarded and recognised in whatever manner is appropriate.

At Lendlease, your career journey can take many paths, providing you with a variety of learning opportunities. We encourage you to take responsibility for your own career development by using the career and job framework (CJF) and development tools available to determine you career path.

What is the Career and Job Framework (CJF)?
All roles at Lendlease are grouped according to our career and job framework (CJF). Our CJF provides a common language for us to understand and manage the capability of our workforce.Our CJF is used across all People & Culture activities including compensation, learning, strategic workforce planning, talent acquisition and career development. It is also utilised through the financial processes in both invoicing and forecasting. The frameworks also changes and adapts as our business evolves.Our framework makes no reference to organisational structure or hierarchy, and is focused purely on the capability required for a role. This helps you identify where your skills and capabilities can be used throughout the business, rather than limiting your career path to your current business unit. The CJF is more than just categorising the roles – it gives you the opportunity to reach your potential and go places with us. You can use the CJF library tool to explore the various job categories, job levels and broad position descriptions available within each job family.  This will help you understand the capability required for different roles and enable you to focus on developing any gaps for your preferred career path.
How do I use the CJF library?
The CJF library provides you with visibility of all the roles available within Lendlease according to our CJF. By searching on 'job family', you will be shown the various roles that exist across job categories and job levels.  Then by clicking on a role, you will be able to view a broad job description.There are 3 job types: - Individual contributor roles do not have people leader responsibilities- People leader roles have line manager responsibilities for Lendlease employees.  - Executive roles are the most senior roles in the organisation identified by group management.Select from the drop-down fields to display information according to a particular job family or category.  You can return to the complete listing of our job families at any time if you would like to explore alternative career paths in different job families within Lendlease.
The CJF library can be accessed via Workday.
How do I plan my development?
Once you have identified your ideal career path, we encourage you to take ownership of your development by proactively using the 70:20:10 learning approach, where: - 70% of your learning should come from experiences, projects and working through tasks.- 20% of your learning should come from relationships like manager interactions, mentoring and networking. - 10% of your learning should come from traditional development activities like training, seminars, conferences and courses. 
How do I locate current vacancies?
If you are ready to make your next career move and want to keep informed about internal opportunities, you view this information via the Career Worklet on Workday. It is important to note that while our CJF uses broad global job titles, the current job opportunities on the careers page refers to local business titles. Visit the internal recruitment page on Pulse for more information on the internal recruitment and selection process.

Position management helps an organisation clearly define and arrange its structure to better meet operational requirements, now and in the future. Under a Position Management approach, firstly the team structure is determined based on the resource requirements and all positions and levels are identified. People are then assigned to positions within that structure. Position Management allows managers to have visibility of all roles (in real time) including vacant positions, so they can make decisions around backfilling or closing a vacant position. This will also assist with headcount planning, budgeting and reporting as well as other people management activities (e.g. separations, job change)

Effective Date May 2015

Review DateFebruary 2019

Next Review Date                           February 2020

PURPOSE The Lendlease Group comprising Lendlease Corporation Limited and Lendlease Responsible Entity Limited as responsible entity of the Lendlease Trust (Lendlease) is committed to building a workplace in which all individuals are supported, respected and connected. SCOPE  Lendlease embraces all employee differences including age, gender, ethnicity, physical appearance, physical or mental disabilities, values, lifestyle, religion, sexual orientation and identity, nationality, education, family responsibilities and military or veteran status and recognises the benefits that diversity brings to maximise corporate goals. POLICY Reasons for Diversity and Inclusion To create the best places, we need a culture and an environment that embraces and respects difference. One where people can bring their ‘whole self’ to work and feel safe, empowered and motivated to be the best they can be. Diversity and Inclusion is a key enabler to realising our vision to create the best places. Specifically: • Innovation and productivity – to remain competitive and to differentiate in the market, innovation is critical. We know that our people will be more innovative, productive and engaged when they can bring their ‘whole self’ to work. • Core values – Diversity and inclusion is key to bringing our desired culture and core values to life. • Employer of choice – Lendlease strives to be an employer of choice and an inclusive culture, embedded throughout the employee life cycle, is critical to this. • Global market forces – Lendlease is a global company made up of people with diverse ideas, experiences and backgrounds. We need to harness this to realise greater productivity and success. • It’s the right thing to do – whilst we aspire beyond compliance to market best practice in Diversity and Inclusion, we can’t ignore the important compliance elements to ensuring that our workforce is inclusive and free of any harassment or discrimination. The Board’s Commitment The Lendlease Board fully supports Diversity and Inclusion, and is instrumental in driving Lendlease’s Diversity and Inclusion agenda. As part of its wider process of increasing diversity and inclusion across the Group, Lendlease is focused on: • realising gender equality throughout all key employee experiences, including recruitment, performance and remuneration reviews and development opportunities; • realising workplace flexibility for all employees across the Lendlease Group; • creating accessible ‘places’, both for our employees in workplace design and our customers in construction design; • driving an inclusion culture through communication and education campaigns; • providing holistic support to our employees in their role as carers. In relation to gender diversity, the Board has set targets in accordance with the ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations. The achievement of these goals will be supported by succession planning, career development programs, graduate programs, mentoring and recruiting activities. Objectives are reviewed by the Board on an annual basis. Board Composition - Commitment When identifying candidates for vacancies on the Lendlease Board of Directors, the Nomination Committee: a) will commit to achieving a Board composition that reflects a diversity of backgrounds, knowledge, experience and abilities; b) include at least one female as part of the interview and selection panel for Board appointments; and c) for Board succession planning, identify and include female candidates with suitable skills and experience. Lendlease will disclose annually, the proportion of women in senior executive positions against targets and the number of women on the Lendlease Board. Diversity and Inclusion Goals of Lendlease Five key goals underpin Lendlease’s approach to managing Diversity and Inclusion, and they are as follows: 1. Become a leader in establishing and maintaining a diverse and inclusive workplace. 2. Include and embed diversity and inclusion principles in the Lendlease culture so that they are followed in the Lendlease community.3. Provide career development opportunities for all key talent in a fair and equitable way. 4. Continually educate all employees about the importance of a diverse and inclusive workplace to business success. 5. Ensure fairness and parity in creating and maintaining a diverse and inclusive workplace. Measuring Diversity and Inclusion Lendlease is committed to becoming a leader in establishing and maintaining a Diverse and Inclusive workplace. A number of methods are used to assess Lendlease’s performance in terms of achieving its diversity goals. These include: • Employee perceptions which are measured quantitatively and qualitatively. Periodic global employee engagement surveys will assess sentiment on a quantitative basis, and employee focus groups and feedback forums, will capture sentiment on a qualitative basis. These will identify issues, collect ideas, test solutions and track and measure sentiment regarding a range of diversity topics including cultural diversity, workplace flexibility and gender equity. All results drive diversity priorities. • Employee Resource Groups governed by Regional Diversity Councils, continually track issues and identify opportunities to further progress the Groups Diversity and Inclusion agenda and performance. • Employee data such as workforce diversity by itself as well as across employee learning and development, succession planning and recruitment, are tracked and used to further refine diversity and inclusion strategies, initiatives and processes. For example in relation to gender equity, key data is tracked including gender splits by region, business, role and level, retention development programs and the recruitment process. • External benchmarking is undertaken on a regular basis. We compare ourselves to other organisations, both within industry and more broadly on a number of key Diversity and Inclusion criteria. Managing Diversity and Inclusion Day to Day The following committees and councils oversee Lendlease’s Diversity and inclusion strategies: • The People and Culture (P&C) Committee is a committee of the Lendlease Board to which the Board has delegated the responsibility to review the effectiveness of policies on workplace diversity and equal opportunity. Diversity and Inclusion issues are considered during discussion at every P&C Committee meeting and recommendations are made to the Board as appropriate. The P&C Committee will establish with management and the Board a process that will also measure the extent to which the Board and senior executives adhere to the measurable objectives. • The Nomination Committee is responsible for reviewing the performance of existing Lendlease Board members and identifying potential board candidates. The Nomination Committee provides advice and support to the Board so that the Board is comprised of individuals who in combination bring a mix of expertise, skills, experience and perspectives and who will enhance the Board’s strength and range of insight. • The Global Head of Diversity and Inclusion works with the Global and Regional Leadership teams to determine priorities and drive implementation of the global Diversity and Inclusion programs which are reflective of Board recommendations and consistent global priorities. Disclosure  Information regarding Lendlease’s Diversity and Inclusion policy, strategies and performance is included in the Group’s Annual Report.A copy of this policy is available on the Lendlease website at www.lendlease.com in the ‘Corporate Governance’ section. Endorsed by the Board on 21 February 2019.

Our formal conversations, whether they are for goal setting, mid-year review or year-end review, are a great opportunity to reflect upon performance as well as other important aspects of our work and life.Below, we have compiled a range of guides and support materials to help you in having meaningful conversations about:- Wellbeing,- Flexibility, and- Personal Development.Don’t forget that our People Connect team are here to help you with any questions you may have about performance conversations and Workday. 
Wellbeing
Wellbeing and performance go hand in hand. There are many factors that affect your health and wellbeing, such as organisational change, financial pressures, maintaining good mental health, transitioning back to work, and more. Use these guides to help you to start a conversation with your manager about health and wellbeing.
Wellbeing Guide for Managers      English   Chinese   Japanese   ItalianWellbeing Guide for Employees      English   Chinese   Japanese   Italian 
Flexible Work Options
We know that when we find flexible work solutions that support both our people’s flex needs and our business objectives, it’s a win-win for everyone. Our flexible work policy, available here, outlines the types of flex arrangements that may be considered and the roles & responsibilities of employees and managers.
 Personal Development Planning Whether you’re looking for your next move up the ladder, pivoting your career focus, or wanting to keep your skills up to date and relevant, having a development plan will help you focus on your learning activities by creating tangible goals that you can measure. Your development plan is uniquely yours, though it is important that you discuss your development goals with your manager so they can support you in your goals.Personal Development Plan      English   Chinese   Japanese   Italian

Career Resources
   English
Review your Goals As work priorities and objectives can change throughout the year, performance conversations are a great opportunity to review and revisit your goals to ensure they are still relevant and meaningful. These guides will help you to review and refocus the goals you have set.
Goal Setting Guidelines      English   Chinese   Japanese   Italian

When do Performance conversations take place?
Goal setting takes place at the start of the financial year, usually in August. 
We recommend you schedule time to have your mid-year review conversation in January or February.
Year-end conversations take place in June and July each year.  Because year-end reviews are captured in Workday, each June we communicate a detailed timeline that highlights specific due dates.

How should I prepare for my performance review conversations?
Performance review conversations are an opportunity to reflect and reset. Think about your achievements and what has gone well, but also what hasn’t gone as planned and the lessons you have learned along the way.  It is also helpful to reflect not only on WHAT you achieved, but also HOW you achieved it.
While performance is a key conversation during these meetings, we also suggest you take the opportunity to discuss other important topics like flexibility, wellbeing and personal development.
There are also great resources on Workday Learning to help you in developing your skills in giving and receiving feedback, development planning, and setting effective goals (plus many more!).

Approver's name and title:Teena HesterHead of People & Culture, Americas

Effective date:January 2017

Approval date:December 2016

Next review date:January 2019

PURPOSE
The Hourly Paid Time-Off Policy provides flexibility to help meet the personal needs of our hourly employees and offer an opportunity for rest and relaxation.
SCOPE
This policy applies to all active, hourly, full time and part time, non-union employees who have worked more than 90 days with the company with no break in service. This policy applies to employees based in North America.
POLICY
This plan is designed to provide all full-time and part-time, non-union hourly employees working more than 90 consecutive days, with the flexibility to meet their personal needs during the work week.
Eligible employees will accrue Paid Time-Off (PTO) hours, calculated based on time worked, at a rate of .0385 hours per hour of work, including PTO hours, and capped at 40 hours per week. PTO will be calculated at the start of employment and hours will be deemed accrued and may be used 90 days from the employment start date. Employees may accumulate a maximum limit of 160 hours.

Maximum PTO accrued in any one week is 1.54 hours (.0385 x 40 hours = 1.54)
Maximum PTO accrued in any one year is 80 hours (1.54 x 52 weeks = 80)

PTO Hours: PTO hours may be used as a benefit outside of normal wage, for regularly scheduled work hours on which an employee does not work. In addition to regularly scheduled hours, PTO hours can be substituted for unpaid holidays, if requested. PTO hours may be taken in increments of not less than one (1) hour. PTO hours will not be considered hours worked towards overtime pay in a pay cycle and may not be used after the last day of work upon separation from the company. PTO hours must be fully accrued to be used.
PTO Pay Procedure: When coding PTO hours on the electronic time sheet, a weekly paid employee will enter "Pay Type" 36; enter "Pay Type" 86 if paid bi-weekly. If you record your hours on a written timesheet you should write "PTO" on the days in which you take PTO hours.
Scheduling PTO: If the need for PTO hours is foreseeable (when an employee can predict or know in advance they will need to use PTO hours, such as a doctor’s visit, planned personal time or vacation), then employees must provide their supervisor with advanced notice 7 days prior to the date on which such PTO is to begin, or as early as possible. If the need for PTO hours is unforeseeable (when an employee is not able to know in advance or predict he or she will need to use PTO hours, such as a medical emergency or sudden illness), then employees must provide their supervisor with notice as soon as practicable. Failure to provide reasonable notice may result in disciplinary action. Employees may take a maximum of 80 hours per year. Any additional PTO requested would need the approval of the BU leader. PTO hours may not be scheduled or taken after an employee’s physical last day worked with the company.
PTO Benefits at Termination: Upon separation from employment, accrued but unused PTO hours will be paid out upon termination of employment.  An employee's last day of employment is their last day physically worked. PTO may not be used to extend last day worked.

You want to find balance in your life
You want some time to focus on you 

It’s a common misconception that therapy is only for people with a serious ‘problem’. Many people can benefit from therapy and coaching. The ideas above are just a starting point, and there may be other reasons why you could benefit from talking to a therapist or coach. If you are unsure if therapy or coaching is for you, why not give it a try and discuss this with the practitioner.  

Important note: Unmind Talk isn’t a crisis service. If you’re feeling suicidal or having thoughts of harming yourself or others, or at risk from someone else, please contact your local emergency service. You can find more information on coping in a crisis in the Mental Health Resources section of the Unmind platform.  

The Unmind platform is 100% confidential 

Unmind and Lendlease both understand that your privacy is very important. 

Unmind will not share any details about individual usage of the platform with Lendlease. That information is private and confidential to you. 

Unmind shares anonymised and aggregated high level data with Lendlease that includes details of how many people are signed up, what parts of the platform are being used and how many therapy and coaching sessions are happening each month.  

Unmind will never share any information about your individual usage with Lendlease. 

How is Unmind different from a traditional EAP? 

Unmind is a confidential online platform for mental health and wellbeing. No one else ever knows if you are using it.
Unmind provides you with the tools to understand your mental health, and digital content to help nurture it.
You can select an experienced therapist or coach, from a range of backgrounds, to speak to within days.
There are no limits to the number of sessions you can have with a therapist or coach. 

Sometimes, we may feel out of sorts, but it’s hard to put your finger on why you feel a certain way, or how to get past that feeling. Unmind is taking away the unknowns and giving you the control. 

Can my family use Unmind too? 

Yes. You can add two family members to your Unmind account and they will have the same access as you. They must be over the age of 18. 

You can invite your family member to set up a new account following these instructions: 

Go to the Unmind mobile app:
Go to Settings (hamburger menu) in the top right corner of your screen.  
From the Settings menu, click “Send an Invite” 
Then click “Invite a loved one”  
You’ll then be able to share an invite link via email, WhatsApp or any other channel 
Your loved one will then receive an email inviting them to sign up to Unmind.  

Employees can update their family member access at any time. There is a 30-day grace period to all users whose access is removed from Unmind. That said, once the new family member is added, the existing family member will continue to have access to the platform for 30 days prior to the new family member being added.  

What happens to Unmind access for myself and any family members if I resign from Lendlease? 

For employees who resign from Lendlease, access to Unmind will cease when you leave as it is linked to the Lendlease single sign on process. For family members it will be the same as their access will no longer work when you leave. This relates to both the Unmind digital platform for self-directed learning and all therapists or coaches. 

For all therapy and coaching we encourage you to ascertain any aspects to cover off with your practitioner before access ceases. If you have a good connection with them, you could ask if they take on private clients of which any costs would need to be covered by the individual. 

About Unmind Therapists and Coaches 

What is therapy? 

Therapy is a talking-based approach typically for people struggling with mental health difficulties, but it is also useful for exploring what’s going on in your life and how you are managing day to day.   

What is coaching? 

Coaching is also talk-based, but it is designed to support you to achieve future goals, make life changes and unlock your potential. Coaches will use a variety of techniques to motivate you, provide clarity and give you a deeper sense of self-awareness.  

Are Unmind’s therapists and coaches good quality? 

Unmind follows a thorough vetting process for both therapists and coaches to ensure they are experienced and accredited/licensed in line with the relevant professional bodies and country and state regulations. Therapists and coaches must have professional indemnity insurance to practice. Unmind collects regular feedback about therapists and coaches from employees using the Unmind Talk service to ensure high quality and continuous improvement.  

What if I feel like my therapist or coach isn’t a good fit? 

It is important that you feel comfortable with your therapist or coach and that it feels like a natural fit. Sometimes you know instantly, and sometimes it takes a few sessions. If you decide that your therapist or coach is not a good fit (sometimes this happens, and it’s ok), you can book with another therapist or coach at any stage. We ask that you let your current therapist or coach know that you don't wish to continue with them where possible. This can be done via email. It may be that they can help advise you on whether a different approach might be more helpful to you. If you are feeling a little unsure about what to do, feel free to contact Unmind and they will work through it with you: support@unmind.com 

What can I expect during my first therapy session? 

Typically, sessions will be 50-60 minutes in length. Therapists and coaches will start with an introduction and review of expectations and confidentiality to make sure that you feel comfortable with them and the process. They will then ask you a series of questions to get a better understanding of your background and reasons for booking for the session. They will then ask you about your goals and what you want to achieve to identify whether and how they can best help you. You can discuss together whether the approach they offer is going to be most helpful to you. They may give you some follow up action items that you can take away and practice or apply to your life. 

How should I prepare for my first session? 

Before your first session, we encourage you to ask yourself a few questions which can guide your initial conversations with your coach or therapist. 

 What’s led you to booking the session?
What do you want to talk about?
Do you know what your goals are, or do you need help figuring that out?
What do you want to get out of therapy/coaching?
What do you want your therapist/coach to be like? Do you want someone who holds you accountable, who is a cheerleader, who challenges you?
How do you want your life to look when you are done? 

How often should I see my therapist or coach? 

This will vary depending on your individual situation. You and your therapist or coach will come to this decision together. Whatever decision you and your therapist or coach come to can change over time. Most people have weekly or fortnightly sessions.  

How long will I have to wait for my first session? 

Most therapists and coaches have appointments within a few days, some even the next day! You can book an appointment directly or message the therapist/coach to agree a time.  

What is the cancellation policy for sessions? 

We understand that unplanned events happen and sometimes you may need to cancel a session. Please remember that therapists and coaches put a lot of time into preparing for each session and they protect time in their diary for you. If you have to cancel, please make sure to give your therapist or coach at least one business days’ notice.  

If you cancel a scheduled session with a therapist or coach within one business day of the scheduled start time of the session, Unmind will process the full fee associated with the session and Lendlease will be liable for this fee.  

Please prioritise attending your Unmind session to ensure you receive maximum benefit from the service. Each session comes to you at considerable cost to Lendlease.

I’m having difficulties joining the Unmind session call

Unmind for Australian Construction Workers 

The CWLENDLEASE Unmind platform has been created specifically for Australian Construction Workers who don’t use their Lendlease email addresses and therefore can’t access single sign on (SSO). 

How do I sign up to Unmind if I am an Australia Construction Worker? 

There are two ways to access Unmind for Construction Workers: 

Download the Unmind app; or 
If using the desktop version – type in the URL cwlendlease.unmind.com 

Then: 

Click on the yellow “create an account” button 
In the “Company Name” field type in CWLENDLEASE and click “Connect” 
Enter your Employee ID – this is the 6-digit Lendlease ID number located at the top of your payslip 
Enter your preferred email address and password 

Important note:  When logging back into Unmind after some time away, you will be prompted to enter the “Company Name” before you enter your email and password.  Ensure you use CWLENDLEASE and not just Lendlease (the Lendlease platform requires a Lendlease email address to be used for single sign-on.)  The CWLENDLEASE platform has been created specifically for Lendlease Construction Workers who don’t use their Lendlease email addresses.
